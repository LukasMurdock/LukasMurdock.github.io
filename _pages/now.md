## What is a now page?

[A “now page” tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life](https://nownownow.com/about). Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

## Working towards a Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing
See my [college course list](https://lukasmurdock.com/college-transcript/). ETA 2023.

## Exploring
Most of my learning comes from [wondering around online](https://lukasmurdock.com/aroundtheweb/) or [diving into books](https://lukasmurdock.com/booklist/). Who knows where I’ll go. Trying to figure out what I’m focused on. Working on feeling secure.
