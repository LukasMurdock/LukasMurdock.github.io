## What is a now page?

[A “now page” tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life](https://nownownow.com/about). Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

## Working

Turning coffee into code over at [SkyCatchFire](https://www.skycatchfire.com/).

## Exploring

Most of my learning comes from [wondering around online](/aroundtheweb/) or [diving into books](/booklist/). Who knows where I’ll go. Trying to figure out what I’m focused on. Working on feeling secure.

So much I [want to learn](/wtl) and [want to read](/wanttoread/).

Making my way through [Edward Tufte’s books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi).

## Top goal

2023-05-14: [Learn](/wtl/), [read](/wanttoread/), and [write](/why-we-write-2/).

2023-01-04: Receive bachelor degree (2023-05-14: graduated. See my [college course list](/college-transcript/))
