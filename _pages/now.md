## What is a now page?

[A “now page” tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life](https://nownownow.com/about). Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

## Working

Building Hiking Hawaii.

## Exploring

Most of my learning comes from [wondering around online](/aroundtheweb/) or [diving into books](/booklist/). Who knows where I’ll go. Trying to figure out what I’m focused on. Working on feeling secure.

So much I [want to learn](/wtl) and [want to read](/wanttoread/) (created [To Read bookshelf](https://library.lukasmurdock.com/bookshelves/To_Read) in library).
