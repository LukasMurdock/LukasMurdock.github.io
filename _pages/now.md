## What is a now page?

[A “now page” tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life](https://nownownow.com/about). Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

## Working

Turning coffee into code over at [SkyCatchFire](https://www.skycatchfire.com/).

## Exploring

Most of my learning comes from [wondering around online](/aroundtheweb/) or [diving into books](/booklist/). Who knows where I’ll go. Trying to figure out what I’m focused on. Working on feeling secure.

So much I [want to learn](/wtl) and [want to read](/wanttoread/) (created [To Read bookshelf](https://library.lukas.icu/bookshelves/To_Read) in library).

Making my way through

- [How a car works](https://www.howacarworks.com/video-course)

## Running

Training to run my first official half marathon (13.1 miles, 21 kilometers).

## Thinking about

- Programming [state](/state/)

## Top goal

2024-01-07: Get significantly better at extracting knowledge and revealing knowledge.

2023-05-14: [Learn](/wtl/), [read](/wanttoread/), and [write](/why-we-write-2/).
