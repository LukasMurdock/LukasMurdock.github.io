## What is a now page?

[A “now page” tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life](https://nownownow.com/about). Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

## Working

Turning coffee into code over at [SkyCatchFire](https://www.skycatchfire.com/).

## Exploring

Most of my learning comes from [wondering around online](/aroundtheweb/) or [diving into books](/booklist/). Who knows where I’ll go. Trying to figure out what I’m focused on. Working on feeling secure.

So much I [want to learn](/wtl) and [want to read](/wanttoread/) (created [To Read bookshelf](https://library.lukas.icu/bookshelves/To_Read) in library).

Making my way through

- [books](https://library.lukas.icu/bookshelves/Reading_Now)
- Adrian Cantrill’s [AWS Certified Developer - Associate](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-developer-associate) course
- [Smart Interface Design Patterns](https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/)
- [How a car works](https://www.howacarworks.com/video-course)

## Running every day

On 2023-08-08 I decided I was going to run a mile every day. The idea of every day is inspired by [Beeple everydays](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays), [Seth’s blog](https://seths.blog/2017/11/this-is-post-7000/), [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary) by James Clear, and [this post](https://duarteocarmo.com/blog/run-every-day). This every day is a forcing function to

- make me get up from my chair
- make me go outside
- make my heart work
- make some other muscles work
- make me shower

I’ve added some additional exercises to this regime

- run a mile
- Do n pushups
- Do n crunches (a sit-ups without hurting my tailbone)
- Do n dumbbell standing drag curls (had to lookup what this was called)
- Do n dumbbell standing overhead extension (had to lookup what this was called)

I started with n=23, arbitrarily picked because that’s my age. Choosing my age (could choose some division of age as well) lines me up to have a very slow n progression while hopefully remaining maintainable. I’ve seen many similar regimes online where people do 40,50+. I’m not at the point where that’s maintainable. I’m whooped after ~20. Started with 12 pound dumbbells because it’s what I had on hand.

## Top goal

2023-05-14: [Learn](/wtl/), [read](/wanttoread/), and [write](/why-we-write-2/).

2023-01-04: Receive bachelor degree (2023-05-14: graduated. See my [college course list](/college-transcript/))
