Here’s a few different ways you can stay up to date.

## Email Newsletter

Sigh.

I had an automated email that would send out weekly updates, but I got excited about putting a JavaScript framework everywhere, and got my account suspended until further notice.

So, while you can still [sign up for my email newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/fa9e472e92b2/updatesfromlukas), you likely won’t receive any emails for awhile.

## RSS

Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is like a printed newspaper in text format. It's just a bunch of items on a text file.

If you use Apple products, I lovingly recommend the free and open source RSS reader, [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/). It’s one of my favorite [apps that I use](https://lukasmurdock.com/uses).

Zapier has [a list of rss feed reader apps](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/).

### This Sites RSS Feeds
I need to add more feeds, and combine some. For now, here are the feeds I have set up:
- [feed](https://lukasmurdock.com/feed) – Writing
- [aroundtheweb](https://lukasmurdock.com/aroundtheweb.xml) – Around the web, (needs to be fixed)
- [booklist](https://lukasmurdock.com/booklist.xml) – Books I’ve read and don’t want to forget
- [knowledge](https://lukasmurdock.com/knowledge.xml) – Knowledge
- [newsletter](https://lukasmurdock.com/newsletter.xml) – This is what I would load in to send out every week
- [notes](https://lukasmurdock.com/notes.xml) – Like subscribing to my own personal twitter

#### Other RSS feeds
- [Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/newsfeeds.htm)
- [Etymology Nerd](http://www.etymologynerd.com/1/feed)
- [Kottke](http://feeds.kottke.org/json)

## Now

Hopefully, I continue to update [my now page](https://lukasmurdock.com/now) with what I’m focused on at this point in my life.
