## Target Audience
The content on this website is for my future self, who is intelligent and interested, but has forgotten. So I hope to remember why I decided something by noting down everything I found interesting about it for future reference. I hope you might find some topics as interesting as I have, and the essay useful or at least entertaining–but the intended audience is my future self.

## Long Site
I’m looking for more ways to apply the idea of [Long Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Foundation). If you worked on something for the next 60 years, what sort of writing could you create? What could you do if you started now?

> The great French Marshall Lyautey once asked his gardener to plant a tree. The gardner objected that the tree was slow growing and wouldn't reach maturity for 100 years. The Marshall replied, "In that case, there is no time to lose; plant it this afternoon! \
> ― John F. Kennedy

### Long Now Years

You may be confused by five-digit dates. See [Long Now Years](https://longnow.org/ideas/long-now-years-five-digit-dates-and-10k-compliance-at-home/).

## Long Content
I hope to work on projects that are too big to work on normally or too tedious. Thinking Long Now gives you a better perspective to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years. If one persists in collecting glimmers of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like a genius himself.

Starting is hard. One solution is to never *start*. Have perpetual drafts tweaked from time to time. And the rest takes care of itself. It’s about starting, not finishing. Improving, not being perfect.

I wish to create works that persist through time. Works in which the more time passes, the more they improve.

One such approach is the [monograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monograph), but Long Content is any content that gets better over time.

So a goal is to actively think about how to write material that improves with time, and work on writings that will not be finished for years, if at all.

## About Me

I seek to learn about various concepts and become enamored by them. Often, I cannot understand them enough to meaningfully generate the concepts at the time. At best, it will float back up in my thoughts years later, and I’ll go, “Ohhhhhhhh, so _that’s_ what that means!” ([sazen](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/k9dsbn8LZ6tTesDS3/sazen), Sabien, 2022) At worst, articulation will instantiate wrong interpretations that will take years to undo ([knowledge shields](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235032926_Conceptual_Understanding_and_Stability_and_Knowledge_Shields_for_Fending_Off_Conceptual_Change), Spiro et al., 1994).

And yet, I aspire to get significantly better at extracting knowledge and revealing knowledge.

#### PrinciplesYou

Best Match: [Growth Seeker](https://principlesyou.com/archetypes/growthseeker)

Good Match: [Quiet Leader](https://principlesyou.com/archetypes/quietleader)

### Contact

I’m a shy guy with a fear of annoying people whenever I contact them. I’m working to get over that. Inspired by [Patrick Mckenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/), this is a standing invitation: if you want to talk design, development, or marketing, I want to talk to you.
