## Inspiration
David C. Baker, The Business of Expertise, [Getting to Know](https://www.davidcbaker.com/getting-to-know).

Wes Kao, [Spiky Point of View](https://www.weskao.com/blog/spiky-point-of-view-lets-get-a-little-controversial).

## Topics
Articulate bits where you don’t have a thoughtful point of view. Just knowing what you don’t know gives you permission for that confidence about the things that you do know, and in the process allows you be honest about what you don’t know.

I don’t have a thoughtful point of view on:
- Accounting/Finance
- 

## Drop and Give Me 20
> What I want you to give me is 20 insights that emerge from your expertise as applied to a particular focus… As you read your list of 20 things to me nearly off the top of your head, will I have some aha moments? Will I learn something? […] If you can’t articulate your expertise quickly and concisely and in a compelling manner, it’s just simply not true.
