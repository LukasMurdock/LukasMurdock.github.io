### Researching the Industry
After an initial meeting Lukas Murdock got to work on collecting information on OLSD. Over a two-week period, he surfaced important and relevant insights into both the K-12 industry and the community of Olentangy.

### The One Story
The meetings focused on creating one singular story. Olentangy was established in 1953â€”with exponential growth over the last sixty-five years the district has a history. The team began looking for ways to represent that within meetings, with ones, symbols, patterns, but one that really stood out was the idea of a river.

### Defining the Story
Remember those times when you would walk up to the riverside, asking if you really wanted to get your shoes soaked and eventually you decide to do it. You take your first step and the water is ice cold, you begin to feel it sink into your socks and flow through your toes.

The exploration, the uncovering of hidden gems that lay under every unturned stone, the carefree joy of splashing through the water. Each river has a story behind it, formed and shaped over time through its environment, slowly making its own path through life.

Rivers hold a significant place in all of our hearts, through good memories and bad, there is no view like a waterfront view.
