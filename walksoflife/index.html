            volunteers, most of them college students, gathered at the Western
            College for Women (now Western Campus of Miami University) to
            prepare for African-American voter registration in the South. Three
            of the volunteers - James Chaney of Mississippi, and Andrew Goodman
            and Michael Schwerner of New York - disappeared on June 21, 1964, in
            rural Mississippi mere days after leaving Oxford, Ohio. Their bodies
            were discovered forty-four days later, buried in an earthen dam. Ku
            Klux Klan members were later convicted on federal conspiracy
            charges. Erected in 1999, this outdoor amphitheater is a memorial to
            the slain activists, other volunteers, and ideals of the Freedom
            Summer movement. (Ohio Bi-Centennial logo)</span

            given to The Western College for Women by Elizabeth McCullough
            Heath, a member of the Class of 1884, and is dedicated to the glory
            of God through the development of Christian women." Second Bell:
            "Let knowledge grow from more to more, but more of reverence is us
            dwell; that mind and soul, according to well, may make one music as
            before." Third Bell: "Ring out the false, ring in the true." Fourth
            Bell: "Ring out the feud of rich and poor, ring in redress to all
            mankind." Fifth Bell: "Ring in the nobler modes of life, with
            sweeter manners, purer laws." Sixth Bell: "Ring out the old, ring in
            the new." Seventh Bell: "Ring in the love of truth and right, ring
            in the common love of God." Eighth Bell: "Ring out the thousand wars
            of old, ring in the thousand years of peace." Ninth Bell: "Ring in
            the valiant man and free, the larger heart, the kindlier hand."
            Tenth Bell: "Ring out the darkness of the land, ring in the Christ
            that is to be." Eleventh Bell: "One God, one law, one element, and
            one far-off divine event, to which the whole Creation moves."
            Twelfth Bell: "Ring out the winds of remembering." Thirteenth Bell:
            "Bells of the past, whose long forgotten music still finds the wide
            expanse." Fourteenth Bell: "Bells that sing heaven's praise with
            such an earthly tongue.</span
