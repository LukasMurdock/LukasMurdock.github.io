	<p>Donâ€™t feel pressured to read all of these or even click on each link.</p>

	<p>This is about finding and exploring <em>what you want to do right now.</em></p>

	<p>Itâ€™s easier to favor your present self at the expense of your future self. Or in other words, itâ€™s much easier to eat some more cake, start another TV series, stay up late, or procrastinate than it is to do work that benefits your future self.</p>

	<p>So do your best to spend your time in a way that benefits your future self.</p>

	<p>You can still watch your shows and do whatever you do, butÂ <em>spend just a little bit of time building</em>,Â and youâ€™ll be ahead of 99 percent of everyone else.</p>

	<p>Maybe even decide to read a few books about something youâ€™re interested in.</p>

	<p>Often, thereâ€™s no way to tell if what youâ€™re doing will help you in the future.</p>

	<p>And itâ€™s up to you to explore.</p>

	<hr>
	<p><strong>The means of learning are abundant; the desire to learn is scarce.</strong> We need you to connect. We need you to lead. To do work that matters for people who care. We need you to want something more.</p>

	<p>Become someone who learns on their own rather than needing someone else to tell you.</p>

	<p>We need you to do work without a map. Learn as you go, but go.</p>
