  <h2 class="index-title" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Enroll yourself<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: 400; margin-bottom:0px;">November 01, 2019</p></h2>
  <p>Enrollment is not what happens when you sign up with the nearby school and then they threaten to throw the parents in jail if the kid doesn’t show up in class. Enrollment is what we call it when someone is eagerly present. When a consultant has enrollment from a client, the client is saying to her, “Yes, we want to move forward. Show us how.” As opposed to the consultant having to cajole and push and basically encourage the client to go forward.</p>

<p>There’s an important distinction because most of the education that most of us have had is not education we enrolled for. Or if we did enroll, we enrolled once at the beginning and then we were waiting for the two-year MBA to be over or we were waiting for the driver ed class to be over. We weren’t actually seeking to engage in the work itself.</p>

<p>So what we have to figure out how to do, whether it’s for third graders or for a MOOC, is continue to amplify the cycle of enrollment. Continue to create an environment where people would miss it if there was a snow day. They would miss it if someone said we don’t have to do that page.</p>

  <h2 class="index-title" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Just start making<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: 400; margin-bottom:0px;">October 31, 2019</p></h2>
  <p>We don’t put enough out into the world. We don’t hold any implementation intentions within ourselves and we hardly stick to any. We need a shift in how we think about and handle projects. To focus on making things in the open, to invite collaboration where everyone benefits. To start more projects for ourselves. We look to characters and cast to endlessly consume and live vicariously through them. I’m afraid of not becoming everything I could be, I look up to people who do work that makes a positive change yet I remain still with worry about not becoming someone like that. I seek to do work that is recognized and be proud of my work. To change from sitting alone in a dark room to having deep conversations with strangers. So I’ll measure. And I’ll measure projects. It’s time I got started, I’ll feel proud after I stick to it.</p>
