  <p>The norm seems to only act once you’re told. No one cares to do anything until they’re told what to do by the teacher. And if they have questions—it’s straight back to the teacher. Learning became a means to an end. Why do we learn? We learn to pass the test. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The university, in a society ruled by public opinion, was to have been an island of intellectual freedom where all views were investigated without restriction.”
<span style="font-size: 12px;">Saul Bellow, Introduction to <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody challenges what they are told. And trying to will get you shut out from having any opinion at all within the group. Only caring about what they’re told to care about by everyone else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They are little able to defend their experience, which had seemed unquestionable until questioned, and it is most resistant to cool analysis. Yet if a student can—and this is most difficult and unusual—draw back, get a critical distance on what he clings to, come to doubt the ultimate value of what he loves, he has taken the first and most difficult step toward the philosophic conversion. Indignation is the soul’s defense against the wound of doubt about its own; it reorders the cosmos to support the justice of its cause. It justifies putting Socrates to death. Recognizing indignation for what it is constitutes knowledge of the soul, and is thus an experience more philosophic than the study of mathematics.”
<em>The Closing of the American Mind</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems as if people operate with the minimum viable effort. My first semester in University has been one of the most intellectually draining experiences of my life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Education in our times must try to find whatever there is in students that might yearn for completion, and to reconstruct the learning that would enable them autonomously to seek that completion.” <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’re letting ourselves down by waiting for instruction. Became obsessed with forward motion in making positive change happen that you’re proud of. Do that and you’ll often find yourself face-first against the waves of normality.</p>

<p>We learn what we do, not what we’re told. What can you do today?</p>

  <h2 class="index-title" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Silence in a world that won't stop talking<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: 400; margin-bottom:0px;">November 03, 2019</p></h2>
  <p>We like to think that we value individuality, but all too often we admire one type of individual—the kind who’s comfortable “putting himself out there.”</p>

<p>In the Culture of Character, the ideal self was serious, disciplined, and honorable. What counted was not so much the impression one made in public as how one behaved in private. The word personality didn’t exist in English until the eighteenth century, and the idea of “having a good personality” was not widespread until the twentieth. But when they embraced the Culture of Personality, Americans started to focus on how others perceived them. They became captivated by people who were bold and entertaining. “The social role demanded of all in the new Culture of Personality was that of a performer,” Susman famously wrote. “Every American was to become a performing self.”</p>

<p>The pressure to entertain, to sell ourselves, and never to be visibly anxious keeps ratcheting up.</p>

<p>At the onset of the Culture of Personality, we were urged to develop an extroverted personality for frankly selfish reasons—as a way of outshining the crowd in a newly anonymous and competitive society. But nowadays we tend to think that becoming more extroverted not only makes us more successful but also makes us better people. We see salesmanship as a way of sharing one’s gifts with the world.</p>

<p>Half of a students’ grade and a much larger percentage of their social status is based on whether they throw themselves into this fray. If a student talks often and forcefully, then he’s a player; if he doesn’t, he’s on the margins.</p>

<p>But when he analyzed what the highest-performing companies had in common, the nature of their CEOs jumped out at him. Every single one of them was led by an unassuming man like Darwin Smith. Those who worked with these leaders tended to describe them with the following words: quiet, humble, modest, reserved, shy, gracious, mild-mannered, self-effacing, understated. The lesson, says Collins, is clear. We don’t need giant personalities to transform companies. We need leaders who build not their own egos but the institutions they run.</p>

<p>Work alone. You’re going to be best able to design revolutionary products and features if you’re working on your own. Not on a committee. Not on a team. The New Groupthink elevates teamwork above all else. It insists that creativity and intellectual achievement come from a gregarious place.</p>

<p>What’s so magical about solitude? In many fields, Ericsson told me, it’s only when you’re alone that you can engage in Deliberate Practice, which he has identified as the key to exceptional achievement. When you practice deliberately, you identify the tasks or knowledge that are just out of your reach, strive to upgrade your performance, monitor your progress, and revise accordingly.</p>

<p>Teens who are too gregarious to spend time alone often fail to cultivate their talents “because practicing music or studying math requires a solitude they dread.”</p>

<p>They had good ideas, Osborn believed, but were loath to share them for fear of their colleagues’ judgment. For Osborn, the solution was not to have his employees work alone, but rather to remove the threat of criticism from group work. He invented the concept of brainstorming, a process in which group members generate ideas in a nonjudgmental atmosphere. Brainstorming had four rules:
Don’t judge or criticize ideas.
Be freewheeling. The wilder the idea, the better.
Go for quantity. The more ideas you have, the better.
Build on the ideas of fellow group members.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that performance gets worse as group size increases: groups of nine generate fewer and poorer ideas compared to groups of six, which do worse than groups of four.</p>

<p>If you have talented and motivated people, they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority. The one exception to this is online brainstorming. Groups brainstorming electronically, when properly managed, not only do better than individuals, research shows; the larger the group, the better it performs.</p>

<p>We should actively seek out symbiotic introvert-extrovert relationships, in which leadership and other tasks are divided according to people’s natural strengths and temperaments. The most effective teams are composed of a healthy mix of introverts and extroverts, studies show, and so are many leadership structures.</p>

<p>We also need to create settings in which people are free to circulate in a shifting kaleidoscope of interactions, and to disappear into their private workspaces when they want to focus or simply be alone.</p>

<p>Introverts are constitutionally programmed to downplay reward—to kill their buzz, you might say—and scan for problems. “As soon they get excited,” says Newman, “they’ll put the brakes on and think about peripheral issues that may be more important. Introverts seem to be specifically wired or trained so when they catch themselves getting excited and focused on a goal, their vigilance increases.”</p>

<p>Chinese high school students tell researchers that they prefer friends who are “humble” and “altruistic,” “honest” and “hardworking,” while American high school students seek out the “cheerful,” “enthusiastic,” and “sociable.”</p>

<p>Introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts; extroverts prefer those they compete with.</p>

<p>Introverted patients responded better and interacted longer with robots that were designed to speak in a soothing, gentle manner: “I know it is hard, but remember that it’s for your own good,” and, “Very nice, keep up the good work.” Extroverts, on the other hand, worked harder for robots that used more bracing, aggressive language: “You can do more than that, I know it!” and “Concentrate on your exercise!”</p>

<p>Spend your free time the way you like, not the way you think you’re supposed to.</p>

  <h2 class="index-title" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Quiet yourself<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: 400; margin-bottom:0px;">November 02, 2019</p></h2>
  <p>Life is full of people prescribing ways they believe you should live. Both online and in-person, if you don’t fit perceptions of normal you’ll be told to shape up. If you want to be successful, you’ll hear all about how you have to be outgoing, boisterous and extraverted. That to be anything valuable in life you must push your way to it. Quiet, nonassertive and introverted? You’re not going to make it anywhere. This is the way our culture has been shaped. Schools, educators, and workplaces preach extroverted ideals into spaces where quiet people are shamed for their natural tendencies. Where people who throw themselves into this game and talk often and forcefully are considered a player—someone who advances in the game. And those who don’t are viewed as those who won’t advance because they are not a player.</p>

<p>We’ve made it seem that you have to work hard at being outgoing, or else you’re going to be left behind. Imagine instead if we preferred to contribute only when we believe we have something insightful to add, or actually disagree with someone. Or how about the way we view day-to-day activities? In school, taking time to be alone is sad and going out to party is something “everyone does so why don’t you.”</p>

<p>It’s time to consider how we see those different than us—and it turns out everyone is different from us. It’s time to slow down, <a href="https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/">“test our assumptions, and reconstruct our ideas before we end up bound by what other people tell us—trapped in the way things have always been done.”</a></p>

  

  
  

  
  <h2 class="index-title" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Enroll yourself<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: 400; margin-bottom:0px;">November 01, 2019</p></h2>
  <p>Enrollment is not what happens when you sign up with the nearby school and then they threaten to throw the parents in jail if the kid doesn’t show up in class. Enrollment is what we call it when someone is eagerly present. When a consultant has enrollment from a client, the client is saying to her, “Yes, we want to move forward. Show us how.” As opposed to the consultant having to cajole and push and basically encourage the client to go forward.</p>

<p>There’s an important distinction because most of the education that most of us have had is not education we enrolled for. Or if we did enroll, we enrolled once at the beginning and then we were waiting for the two-year MBA to be over or we were waiting for the driver ed class to be over. We weren’t actually seeking to engage in the work itself.</p>

<p>So what we have to figure out how to do, whether it’s for third graders or for a MOOC, is continue to amplify the cycle of enrollment. Continue to create an environment where people would miss it if there was a snow day. They would miss it if someone said we don’t have to do that page.</p>

  <h2 class="index-title" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Just start making<p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: 400; margin-bottom:0px;">October 31, 2019</p></h2>
  <p>We don’t put enough out into the world. We don’t hold any implementation intentions within ourselves and we hardly stick to any. We need a shift in how we think about and handle projects. To focus on making things in the open, to invite collaboration where everyone benefits. To start more projects for ourselves. We look to characters and cast to endlessly consume and live vicariously through them. I’m afraid of not becoming everything I could be, I look up to people who do work that makes a positive change yet I remain still with worry about not becoming someone like that. I seek to do work that is recognized and be proud of my work. To change from sitting alone in a dark room to having deep conversations with strangers. So I’ll measure. And I’ll measure projects. It’s time I got started, I’ll feel proud after I stick to it.</p>
