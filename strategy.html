				<h3><strong>Positioning</strong></h3>	
				<p>The heart of a brand. Working to define what a brand is, its benefits, its competitive advantages, and what it means to the target market. Most importantly, brand positioning establishes an emotional connection with your customers. It’s how you want your company to be perceived in their minds and among competitors.</p>			
			
				<h3><strong>User Profiles & Journeys</strong></h3>	
				<p>Using customer segmentation to craft user profiles that represent target markets, then designing scenarios in which those users might interact with the brand. Defining informed interactions helps predict pain points and insight into functionality and user behavior.</p>			
				
				<h3><strong>Brand Attributes</strong></h3>	
				<p>Characteristics that describe the intrinsic and extrinsic qualities of a brand. Uncovering brand attributes allows its personality, functionality, and physical traits to emerge through imagery, language, actions, and assumptions. It is brand attributes that allow us to identify brands.</p>			
				
				<h3><strong>Competitive Audit</strong></h3>	
				<p>A competitive analysis done thoroughly is critical for any emerging or evolving business. Revealing the strengths and weaknesses in a brand’s competitive landscape allows your company to better understand the market, effectively target customers, and make intelligent decisions about how to grow your brand.</p>
