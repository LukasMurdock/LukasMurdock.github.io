This text describes a long-term project designed to encourage people to think beyond the psychological barrier of the millennium and into the future. The Long Now Foundation, founded by some of the world's most influential and cutting-edge thinkers, plan to build a gigantic mechanical clock, perhaps as large as Stonehenge, in the American desert. It is intended to record time for 10,000 years.",
