		<p>The contexts and audience for my resume are <em>whenever</em> somebody asks to see it and <em>whoever</em> asks to view it. Because my real resume is the work I put out — which is what all of my past and present employers have come to me from, asking me to do work for them instead of me asking.</p>


		<h2>Feedback</h2>
		<blockquote>To earn an A, your resume must make a strong and unique impact in terms of design and content and make you "stand out" to your audience.”</blockquote>
		<p><strong>What stands out to you is not what stands out for everyone.</strong> For example, when looking at Laurin’s resume, the Futura-like font and differing font sizes stood out to me — and likely didn’t stand out to you. Of all the resumes listed, hers is the only one I remember due to writing about those factors.</p>

		<blockquote>employers expect your resume to be one-page (using an 11 or 12 pt. font and approximately one-inch margins)”</blockquote>
		<p>I’ve never had any employer express these expectations, and none of your given examples follow all these said expectations.</p>

		<p>I agree with <em>“There is no one way to design/format a resume,”</em> so how can you follow that with <em>“Also, try a different formatting - to use space effectively.”</em> By that, you mean <em>“filling the page”</em> — something I explicitly don’t want to do.</p>
		
		<p>One reason is readability. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability">Optimal line length is considered to be 50-60 characters per line</a> — my resume clocks in around 65.</p>

		<p>The other reason is space. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_space_(visual_arts)">White space should not be considered merely "blank" space</a>. Japanese holds a specific term for this called “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://new.uniquejapan.com/ikebana/ma/">Ma</a>,” which extends well past design and is apparent throughout the culture. </p>

		<p>This is not to say my utilization of space is effective, but that the idea “fill the space” is not. Each aspect shown is a carefully thought-out decision on my part about how I want to show up in the world through this piece of paper. And it is not the fill-the-space, shout-your-name manner.</p>
		
		<p>If you would like to talk about the reasons behind decisions instead of directives such as ”fill the space,” I would be glad to.</p>
