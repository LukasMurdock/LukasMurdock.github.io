				<p>Lukas Murdock is a student at Miami University and a recent graduate of Olentangy High School in Columbus, OH. After designing title sequences for his high school broadcast programs and publications for the journalism program, he went on to work with local businesses to help build better local and worldwide brand recognition.</p>
				<p>He balances school, running and his internship with personal creative work, like identity design and web design, always taking time to enhance his skills. He is constantly looking for the most cohesive and efficient ways to make everything flow together.</p>
				<p>His creative approach—no matter the medium—is to find the points of purposeful function behind the idea. Iterating hundreds of times until it’s refined into the core function. For Lukas, design isn’t about creating what you want, but rather, a way to create less, but better.</p>
