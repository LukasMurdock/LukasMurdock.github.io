		<p>I'm a student at Miami University and a recent graduate of Olentangy High School in Columbus, OH. I started designing title sequences for the broadcast program and articles for the journalism program in high school. I eventually started to work with businesses to help build better local and worldwide brand recognition.</p>
		<p>I balance school, running and work with personal creative work, like identity design and web design, always taking time to enhance my skills. I am constantly looking for the most cohesive and efficient ways to make everything flow together.</p>
		<p>My creative approach—no matter the medium—is to find the points of purposeful function behind the idea. Iterating hundreds of times until it’s refined into the core function. For me design isn’t about creating what you want, but rather, a way to create less, but better.</p>
