  note: Have a user snippet working for note! Timestamps are still a little jank–but
    it works.

    Working on reducing the friction to create on my site. A few tricks:
    - Ruby script automation (IDK how Ruby plugins really work)
    - Text auto completion and auto formatting in VS Code
      - [YAML Schema](https://dev.to/brpaz/how-to-create-your-own-auto-completion-for-json-and-yaml-files-on-vs-code-with-the-help-of-json-schema-k1i) and [YAML to JSONSchema](https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-to-jsonschema)

    The final straw to finally build a notes page came from:
    1. Wanting to have some ideal calendar for writing
    2. Looking at content calendar templates
    3. Deciding I’ll just create my own *on this site*
    4. Segue to searching for a Mac timer app
    5. Stumbling across [Matthew Palmers](https://matthewpalmer.net/blog/2018/09/28/top-free-countdown-timer-apps-mac/index.html)
    site
    6. Seeing his standing invitation page."
