    The final straw to finally build a notes page came from:
    1. Wanting to have some ideal calendar for writing
    2. Looking at content calendar templates
    3. Deciding I’ll just create my own *on this site*
    4. Segue to searching for a Mac timer app
    5. Stumbling across [Matthew Palmers](https://matthewpalmer.net/blog/2018/09/28/top-free-countdown-timer-apps-mac/index.html)
    site
    6. Seeing his standing invitation page."
