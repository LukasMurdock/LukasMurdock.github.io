Influence by Robert Cialdini
1. Reciprocity
2. Commitment/Consistency
3. Social Proof
4. Authority
5. Liking
6. Scarcity
7. Unity

**Reciprocity: Give a little something to get a little something.**
Example: give free things that people benefit from and they’ll be way more likely to buy something from you.

**Commitment: We want to be consistent with our values.**
Example: multiple small “yes” leads to bigger “yes”.

**Social Proof: We seek validation from others who act like us.**
Example: Testimonials.

**Authority: We listen to seemingly credible, knowledgeable experts.**
Example: Celebrity/Doctor/Research endorsement

**Liking: The more we like someone, the more we're persuaded by them.**
Example: About us

**Scarcity: When supply is low, demand is high.**
Example: “Limited time only!”

**Unity: People like us do things like this.**
Example: Jargon, exclusivity, Us vs them, experience sharing
