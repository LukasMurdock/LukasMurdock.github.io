### Ubiquitous Computing vs. Interface Agents

- something altogether different, even opposed, to interface agents: ubiquitous computing (also known as embodied virtuality)
- outline of this talk:
    - what is ubiquitous computing
    - compare and contrast to interface agents

### Context of work: Xerox PARC

- **A different kind of research in two ways**
    - Reverse technology transfer: PARC transfers research ideas to universities to pursue.
    - We deploy and use our discoveries.
- **Over twenty years of pioneering basic research**
    - Individuals change, innovation continues
    - Steady Xerox commitment to long-range research
    - Laboratories ranging from physics to anthropology, all working together.
- **Connection to Xerox**
    - PARC technology in nearly every product
    - Research a vital part of The Document Company

### Premise: Metaphors Matter

**This is a talk about metaphors and world views**

- **All people see and understand the world as filtered through a world view**
    - The world view itself is not seen
    - Because the world view filters everything, it is hugely influential on what we do
    - Some metaphors become ingrained as world views
- **Metaphors are extremely influential**
    - Plato’s metaphors of ideal forms and knowledge as viewing shadows in a cave influencing 2,000 years of theories of knowing
    - Rousseau’s "Noble Savage" influence in the French revolution, morals, cruel experiments on children
    - The metaphor of the "master molecule" delayed biochemical understanding

### People are most effective and authentic when they are fully engaged, mind and body, in the world

- Examples:
    - flow of the athlete in the groove
    - effortless use of pencil, paper and language when writing
    - "feel for the organism" of the great biologist
    - effortless 65 MPH driving of the experienced driver (while talking, reading roadsigns, ...)
- **This is a basic characteristic of humans, across all cultures**
    - Polynesian navigation between islands depends upon attunement with currents, wind, and weather
    - African tailor apprenticeships via peripheral participation depend upon learning by engagement
- **Technologies should enhance this ability to engage, to "flow" with life and work**

### The most powerful technologies are invisible: they get out of the way to let the human be effective

- **Electricity**
    - Electric motors hidden everywhere (20-30 per car)
    - Electric sockets in every wall and portably available through batteries
    - Integrated, invisible infrastructure
- **Literary Technology**
    - Continuously surrounding us at many scales
    - Used trivially and profoundly
    - Literally visible, effectively invisible

### How to do invisible computing?

- **Integrated computer systems approach**
    - invisible, everywhere, computing
    - named "ubiquitous computing" in April 1989.
- Invisible: tiny, embedded, attachable, ...
- Everywhere: wireless, dynamically configurable, remote access, adapting, ...

### Goals of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp)

- **Ultimate Goal**
    - invisible technology
    - integration of virtual and physical worlds
    - throughout desks, rooms, buildings, and life
    - take the data out of information, leaving behind just an enhanced ability to act
- **Phase I**
    - tabs, pads, and boards
    - hundreds of computers per person
    - wireless networks
    - location-based services
    - shared meeting applications

_Using a computer should be as refreshing as a walk in the woods._


### ubicomp phase 1: Ubiquitous I/O devices

- **Post-it note-sized palmtop computers**
    - One hundred per person per office
    - Always have one on you, wirelessly connected
    - Small touch-sensitive display screen
    - Scatter around the office like postit notes
- **Notebook-sized computers**
    - Ten per person per office
    - Stylus-based input primary
    - Near megabit wireless comm bandwidth
    - Can support multi-media when "tethered"
- **Wall displays**
    - Large ones used as shared display surfaces (replaces whiteboards)
    - Replace physical bulletin boards, etc.
    - Lots of bandwidth available because they’re plugged into the wall.

### Ubicomp is Situated Computing

- **Makes use of simple shared context**
    - space
    - time
    - proximity
    - affordances (Norman)
- **Participation in the context**
    - is physical
    - is out here with us
    - is in many small places, including trivial ones

### Encouraging result: new science from exploring Ubicomp

- theoretical computer science: network security, caching over slow networks, ...
- operating systems: scalable to wristwatches, user-extensible O.S.’s, reliable without redundancy, low power O.S.
- user interfaces, hardware and software: gestures, two-handed input, pie-menus, unistroke alphabets
- networking, hardware and software: radio, infrared, mobile protocols, inbuilding wireless LANs, multimedia protocols over varying bandwidth
- computer architecture, hardware and software: postit-note computers, low power O.S., multimedia pad computers

### Some Ubi-Examples

- **Activity-based Information Retrieval**
    - like filing assistant for physical documents
    - uses events, time, context, who
    - tracks things by badge, and video shape
    - just indexing, no "agent"
- **Physical Retrieval**
    - book or document beeps with answer
    - screens (active, custom, signs) on walls direct you to right shelf, or right clothes, ...
    - Newman and Lamming, EuroPARC

### Agent Premise?

- When is a program an agent?
- Many excellent talks in the morning stretched to cover agents
    - Papert: syntonic and non-true/false schooled thinking
    - Dertouzos: EForms, G.S.S.s
    - Kay: handheld machines used everywhere
    - Negroponte: shared context
- Is a human the right model for the ideal computer?
    - An appealing panacea, and so dangerous
    - Better: make the computer more like things of which we are unaware: eyeballs, hands, ...

### What is the interface agent metaphor?

"I think of a personalized computer as something like a well-trained, long-standing English butler -- someone intimately aware of your idiosyncrasies, your habits, your friends, your goals, and who you deal with."

- You talk to it
- It watches us and learns our needs
- It has "knowledge", is "aware", or has a personality
- It is an assistant

### Example of the different points of view: Pilot’s Assistant

The goal of the pilot’s assistant is to enhance the ability of the pilot to fly the airplane

- **Interface agent: like a co-pilot**
    - watching the planes systems and the situation
    - offering advice, answering questions
- **Ubicomp: like a simpler, better airplane**
    - the arrangement of controls, displays, windows, seats, etc.
    - the ability to act is enhanced by the total system
    - no locus of expertise
- **For example: being alerted of a potential collision**
     - agent: "collision, collision, go right and down"
     - ubicomp: background presentation of airspace information for continuous spatial awareness, as in everyday life. You’ll no more run into another airplane than you would try to walk through a wall.

### Four myths in the agent metaphor

- **Myth 1: voice recognition is important for human/computer interaction**
    - Better: voice may help a little, sometimes
    - _voice recognition_ is to _computer_ as _typewriter_ is to _paper_
- **Myth 2: people know what they want, and a smart assistant could help them get it**
    - Better: people are opportunists, muddling through, never doing exactly the same thing twice
- **Myth 3: people interface with the world**
    - Better: people dwell in the world, so they and the world together are a functioning whole, neither alone.
    - "User interface" embodies a type error: it names a boundary that is instead a union.
    - Is marriage a spousal interface problem, improved by a better GUI? Is ecology a plant/animal interface problem, improved by plants with more MIPS?
- **Myth 4: hierarchical organization is helpful**
    - Better: success in leading comes from understanding, coaching and enabling, not commanding
    - "Master molecule" theories (slime mold, DNA) are not true, instead more complex interaction theories, with no locus of control, are biologically realistic
    - People at the top of hierarchies, e.g. presidents, have little control over the bureaucracy

### What’s wrong with the interface agent metaphor?

- **You talk to it**
    - but what you can say is no different from what you can type: i.e. you lisp at it
    - Myths 1 and 3
- **It watches us and learns our needs**
    - but has no human context for needs
    - Myths 2 and 3
- **It has "knowledge", is "aware", has a personality**
    - must Artificial Intelligence be solved first?
    - Myths 2 and 3
- **It is an assistant**
    - it is underfoot
    - Myth 4

### Some limitations of the interface agent metaphor

- **It does not go far enough**
    - it stops at the notion of an assistant
    - much better is the intuitive or anticipatory computer, that needs no commands
    - aim for an extension of our body, or integration of mind/body/world
- **It keeps the computer in the foreground**
    - personal computer is the wrong idea, intimate computer even worse
    - invisible computer is best
- **It stays within an old paradigm**
    - breakthroughs less likely, because area well studied
- **It obsessively fascinates**
    - the human-like machine to which we give life
    - the perfect, all-powerful, slave
    - be careful when appealing to ancient prejudice

### Some different design principles

| **Interface Agent**                  | **Ubiquitous Computing**                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| single locus of information about me | distributed, partial information by place, time and situation |
| command the computer                 | what computer?                                                |
| personal, intimate, computer         | personal, intimate people                                     |
| filtering                            | breathing, living, strolling                                  |
| user interface                       | no boundary between you and machine                           |
| DWIM _do what I mean_                | WIWYHIAFI _when I want your help I’ll ask for it_             |
| I interact with agent                | I interact with the world                                     |

### Possible problems with ubiquitous computing metaphor

- A good butler is also invisible
- Invisibility is more poorly focused than agents, less amenable to PhD theses and point products
- People want a personal butler, not just a better life
- Ubiquitous computing is harder, because it requires complete new systems thinking
- An intelligent agent is a better model for some things, like information filtering and controlling access to me

### Summary

- Ubiquitous computing avoids metaphors of hierarchy, power, and control, and myths about what it is to be human
- Ubiquitous computing emphasizes metaphors of life, interaction with other people, invisibility, and is leading to new discoveries in computer science

"Using a computer a computer should be as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods."

### Two kinds of issues

- **Desired end state**
    - invisibility vs. explicit interaction
- **Means for achieving either end state**
    - distributed affordances vs. focused expertise
