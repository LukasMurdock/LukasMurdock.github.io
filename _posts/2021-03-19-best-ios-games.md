I was a part of the first generation to grow up from a young age with iPhones, I got my first iPhone, the iPhone 5, sometime early-on in middle school.

As such, I was really into finding and downloading interesting games. For the sake of ordering, I’ve made two sections, the first, *Hands Down the Best Games*, is the games that I would consider to be the best games, but I don’t return too that often, if ever, after finishing them

## Hands Down the Best Games

## The Best Games to Play on Repeat

### 1. PAKO - Car Chase Simulato‪r‬
[Link to PAKO](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pako-car-chase-simulator/id903183877)

Pako seems to have faded into obscurity, I’m not sure if it ever hit mainstream, but it’s always the first game I return to. The driving mechanics are just right. I do wish it was more open, the android version lets you choose what car you use on each map.

There are other versions, PAKO Forever is free and PAKO2 is paid, but for me, neither touch PAKO.

Developed by [Tree Men Games](http://treemengames.com/), and another game is Heli 100.

Price: $1.99

### 2. Polytopia
[Link to Polytopia](https://polytopia.io/)

Honestly, this is the game I’ve probably dropped the most hours into and would be #1 if I wasn’t so burnt out that I can only play so much now.

Developed by [Midjiwan](https://midjiwan.com/).

Price: Free

### 3. Drop7
