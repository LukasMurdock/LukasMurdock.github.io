title: 'SEO SaaS Gap'
description: "Every SEO tool is about data to move forward."

It standardizes and automates processes.

Tools should bring data with directives on how to move forward. Give me data *and the next step*.

The Next Steps are often one of two things:
1. Tweak this
2. Create that

## Tweak This
Data from tools like SurferSEO, Sitebulb and Screaming Frog provide data with the next step being *tweak this:*
- Title
- Description
- Header Count
- URL formatting
- Image size/alt
- etc

But Screaming Frog is the outlier here. SurferSEO and Sitebulb will **tell you by design what you need to tweak**. With Screaming Frog, you need to know what you’re looking at to make tweaks.

## Create that
Data from tools like Ahrefs, BrightLocal, and a different part of SurferSEO provide data with the next step being *create that*.
- keywords
- citations
- articles

## Input
The hallmark of a starter tool is the ability to paste-in a URL to get back data gleamed from the site in various ways.

Because when you’re just starting, your big question is “what do I do?”

And you want your tools to answer that.

Ahrefs primarily gives you pages and sites that link to a given URL or domain.

Screaming Frog primarily gives you metadata for every page across your site.

SurferSEO primarily gives you metadata for every page across your site.

Neither of these tools allow someone to hop into the tool for the first time and go, “I know exactly what I should do now.”

When I go to a restaurant and the items on the menu are new to me, I always defer to the waiters preference. *I don’t know, they’re the experts on their products*.

So starter tools are all about pushing forward what data you can get from one input URL.

And what data is helpful? Data that tells you *tweak this, create that*.
