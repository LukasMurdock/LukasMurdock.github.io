title: 'Tools define process'
description: "Tools come prebuilt with a process that you can learn from."

This idea was first brought to me by the article *[Build tools around workflows, not workflows around tools](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/)* from Linus over at  [thesephist.com](https://thesephist.com/).

And while I generally agree with the statement, I’m more fascinated about what tools can teach us about process.

## Tools answer “what do I do?”
My first instinct in learning about a new field is to ask what software do they use.

Let’s say you want to learn how to do something, maybe video editing.

I like to start by learning the names of tools professionally used and the differences between them. Why do people prefer this tool over that tool.

Instead of starting with questions about ”how to“, I start by looking at debates of professionals in the field regarding the tools they use.

A more concrete example of how tools teach you process is Salesforce.

Salesforce is big enterprise tool for standardized sales processes. So, if you want to learn sales processes, all you have to do is use Salesforce or another leading CRM to see how sales processes work.

Tools teach you a process.

Adopting to standards rather than setting your own.

Network effect kicks in.
