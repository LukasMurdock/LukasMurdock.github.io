We do not gatekeep, but we warn.

Do not mistake certifications for competence. Do not confuse platforms with
community. Do not accept that "responsible disclosure" means asking
permission to be curious.

Read the classics. Study the protocol. Run your own infrastructure. Know
what came before you.

Above all: ask questions, and never wait for answers to be approved.
