Anguish as much as you need but never forget that you are loved, that there are always people ready to lend a hand. We need you. And that voice telling you that you have no value and we don’t need you, that fear telling you you can’t do it, it’s an imagined reality. And in time you will learn to dance with it. And maybe you don’t believe it yet, but the world is better with you in it. The waves never stop coming and when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you’ll come out. And when you do, acknowledge that strength, your strength. Perfection or productiveness do not make you worth loving, you already are. So hold on, reach for another when you can, you don’t need to carry it alone. And when you’re ready, let’s dance.
