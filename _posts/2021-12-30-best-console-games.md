I grew up with an Xbox 360—let’s I got it sometime in middle school. I remember my friends having it before me—and a few of them had a Playstation 2.

For posterity, the games I recall:
- Midnight Club: Los Angeles
- Minecraft
- Super Meat Boy
- Assassins Creed 2
- Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood
- Modern Warfare 2
- Halo: Reach
- Halo 3: ODST
- Mirrors Edge
- Portal 2
- Black Ops 2
- Saints Row: The Third
- Battlefield 4
- Grand Theft Auto 5
- Titanfall
