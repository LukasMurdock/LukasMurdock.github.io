## Shackleton’s Endurance

> We have been compelled to abandon the ship, which is crushed beyond all hope of ever being righted, we are alive and well, and we have stores and equipment for the task that lies before us. The task is to reach land with all the members of the Expedition. It is hard to write what I feel.

The Endurance was crushed by Antarctic ice, stranding 28 men. Shackleton then sailed a 22-foot lifeboat 800 miles across the world’s roughest ocean and crossed unmapped mountains to get help. Every crew member survived.
