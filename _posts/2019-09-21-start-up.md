It’s personal. I want to make a group of my own culture. I wanted to build a site that can become a learning resource for anyone who happens upon it. The goal of this site isn’t to land jobs or to showcase my skills. It’s not a resume or a place to talk about myself. It’s what I can do for those who I can help. This project was inspired by 12 words.

If you had a chance to teach us, what would we learn?
