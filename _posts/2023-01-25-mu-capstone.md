tl;dr: A team of researchers and professors received a grant from the Ohio Department of Higher Education to develop “a downloadable cell-phone ready application” to help people with substance use disorders and their family members find suitable recovery placement options. In addition, the app will provide information on the availability, qualifications, and potential fit of different recovery facilities. The project will last 18 months and involve partnerships with multiple organizations and stakeholders to ensure the app meets the community’s needs.

[Interact for Health](https://interactforhealth.org/) focuses on reducing tobacco use, addressing the opioid epidemic and ensuring that children have access to health care through school-based health centers. They are an independent foundation that serves 20 counties in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana.

M. Cameron Hay, Professor of Anthropology at Miami University, and Abbe Lackmeyer prepared the report “[Recovery Housing Gap Analysis](https://www.interactforhealth.org/upl/media/recovery_housing_gap_analysis.pdf)” for Interact for Health on April 30, 2020.

A proposal was made in 2021 to the ODHE ([Ohio Department of Higher Education](https://highered.ohio.gov/about)).

> As a transdisciplinary team of researchers and professors, we propose to develop a downloadable cell-phone ready application (app) to enable people with substance use disorders and their family members to initiate evidence-based care by finding recovery placement options with up-to-date availability, needed qualifications, and potential fit information.
> […]
> We propose an 18 month project […] to enable people seeking recovery and their family members to easily find and match with available placements with recovery services. This project will be measured by a reduction in reported time and stress it takes to find placement in a recovery house, and a reduction in reported time and stress in filling empty beds at recovery houses.

Phases:
1. Identify characteristics and challenges of the potential app
2. Spring 2022 IMS 351 designs app prototype
3. Summer 2022 GHS 201 tests app prototype
4. Fall 2022 IMS 440 develops app beta
5. Winter 2022 App development tech company finalizes app
6. Spring 2023 Highwire Brand Studio develops marketing campaign for app
7. May 2023 deliver app, business plan, and marketing plan

On May 01, 2022, Miami University news published _The Wrap-Up: May_ and noted an ODHE grant for $278,750.

On the first day, they put us into groups to come up with a list of names, without much explanation. Why? The name and logo they’ve used for 2 years was “denied by legal”.

Items on the syllabus include:
- Market analysis presentation (Mon, Feb 27 – Wed, Mar 1)
- Market strategy presentation (Mon, Apr 3)

## Background on Recovery Housing

Recovery housing is for:
- People who struggle with addiction
- People in addiction recovery
- People leaving residential treatment programs (after addiction program, before returning home)
- People without a home
- People leaving the criminal justice system
- People with mental health issues

Recovery housing is a housing environment that is free from alcohol and illicit drug use and offers peer support, connection to treatment, recovery supports, and other associated supports in the community.

Example recovery home: [Talbert House](https://www.talberthouse.org/help/)

Here are steps someone might take to find themselves in recovery housing from Substance Use Disorder:

Seeking help → Assessment → Detox → Rehabilitation → Aftercare → Ongoing support

1. **Seeking help**: The first step is to admit that there is a problem and to seek help. This could involve talking to a trusted friend or family member, seeing a doctor or mental health professional, or reaching out to a local support group.
2. **Assessment**: A professional will conduct an assessment to determine the extent of the substance use disorder and to develop a treatment plan.
3. **Detox**: Depending on the severity of the addiction, a medical detox may be necessary to help the individual safely withdraw from the substance they are using.
4. **Rehabilitation**: After detox, the individual may enter a rehabilitation program where they receive treatment and support for their addiction. This could involve individual or group therapy, counseling, and participation in support groups.
5. **Aftercare**: Upon completion of the rehabilitation program, the individual may transition to recovery housing where they can continue to receive support as they work on their recovery.
6. **Ongoing support**: It is important for the individual to continue to attend support groups, therapy sessions, and to have a strong support network as they work on their ongoing recovery.

People with SUD (Substance Use Disorder) can find recovery homes through several ways, including:

- Referrals from healthcare providers: Doctors, therapists, or other healthcare providers may know about recovery homes in the area and can make a referral.
- Online resources: There are websites and online directories that list recovery homes and provide information about their services and locations.
- Support groups: Support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous may have information about recovery homes in the area.
- Hotlines: Substance abuse hotlines can provide information about recovery homes and help connect individuals with appropriate resources.
- Community organizations: Community organizations such as churches or non-profits may have information about recovery homes and can provide referrals.

### (2020-04-20) [Interact For Health: Recovery Housing Gap Analysis](https://www.interactforhealth.org/upl/media/recovery_housing_gap_analysis.pdf)

Some states have accrediting or certifying bodies for recovery housing:
- [Ohio Recovery Housing](https://www.ohiorecoveryhousing.org) (ORH)
- [Indiana National Alliance for Recovery Residences](https://inarr.org) (INARR)

Ohio’s population is multiples larger than Indiana and Kentucky combined.

Self reported levels of recovery houses from Ohio:
1. Peer run: 0
2. Monitored: 25 houses, 421 beds (avg 16 beds/house)
3. Supervised: 8 houses, 87 beds (avg 10 beds/house)
4. Service provider: 16 houses, 256 beds (avg 16 beds/house)
5. Unknown: 13 houses, 17 beds (avg 1 bed/house)

Annual estimate of adults who receive SUD treatment in Ohio: 10,660

Summary statistics from Greater Cincinnati region:
- Total houses: 103
- Certified houses: 22 (21%)
- Total beds: 1,259
- Total staff: 228
- Houses with paid staff: 36 (34%)
- Length of stay: 90 days to 3+ years
- Weekly fee: $75-$120
- Monthly fee: $300-$600
- Weekly denials from lacking beds: 56

Recommendations from analysis:
1. More recovery houses
2. More recovery houses in safe residential areas with access to transportation, supportive services, and employment opportunities
3. Regular monitoring of certification process
4. Enable people to estimate potential fit in a house prior to arrival
5. Anti-stigma campaigns about recovery housing
6. Agree on language for recovery housing and attributes for recovery housing
7. Connect committed individuals to place more people struggling with SUD in recovery homes
