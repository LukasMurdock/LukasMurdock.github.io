## Background on project

tl;dr: A team of researchers and professors received a grant from the Ohio Department of Higher Education to develop ‚Äúa downloadable cell-phone ready application‚Äù to help people with substance use disorders and their family members find suitable recovery placement options. In addition, the app will provide information on the availability, qualifications, and potential fit of different recovery facilities. The project will last 18 months and involve partnerships with multiple organizations and stakeholders to ensure the app meets the community‚Äôs needs.

---

[Interact for Health](https://interactforhealth.org/) focuses on reducing tobacco use, addressing the opioid epidemic and ensuring that children have access to health care through school-based health centers. They are an independent foundation that serves 20 counties in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana.

August 22, 2019: [Survey by Miami U. will connect addicts with recovery options](https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/first-its-kind-survey-miami-will-connect-addicts-with-recovery-options/r5qInvsmJKGLL2skFFaWlJ/), funded by Interact for Health.

M. Cameron Hay, Professor of Anthropology at Miami University, and Abbe Lackmeyer prepared the report ‚Äú[Recovery Housing Gap Analysis](https://www.interactforhealth.org/upl/media/recovery_housing_gap_analysis.pdf)‚Äù for Interact for Health on April 30, 2020.

A proposal was made in 2021 to the ODHE ([Ohio Department of Higher Education](https://highered.ohio.gov/about)).

> As a transdisciplinary team of researchers and professors, we propose to develop a downloadable cell-phone ready application (app) to enable people with substance use disorders and their family members to initiate evidence-based care by finding recovery placement options with up-to-date availability, needed qualifications, and potential fit information.
> [‚Ä¶]
> We propose an 18 month project [‚Ä¶] to enable people seeking recovery and their family members to easily find and match with available placements with recovery services. This project will be measured by a reduction in reported time and stress it takes to find placement in a recovery house, and a reduction in reported time and stress in filling empty beds at recovery houses.

Phases:
1. Identify characteristics and challenges of the potential app
2. Spring 2022 IMS 351 designs app prototype
3. Summer 2022 GHS 201 tests app prototype
4. Fall 2022 IMS 440 develops app beta
5. Winter 2022 App development tech company finalizes app
6. Spring 2023 Highwire Brand Studio develops marketing campaign for app
7. May 2023 deliver app, business plan, and marketing plan

[Third Frontier & Technology](https://development.ohio.gov/business/third-frontier-and-technology)

On May 01, 2022, Miami University news published _The Wrap-Up: May_ and noted an ODHE grant for $278,750.

> Cameron Hay-Rollins, chair and professor of Anthropology, Michael Bailey-Van Kuren, interim chair and associate professor of EBTD, Christopher Sutter, associate professor of Entrepreneurship, and Timothy Greenlee, professor of Marketing, received a grant from the Ohio Department of Higher Education of $278,750 for their project ‚ÄúFinding Recovery: Research and Development to Match People with Substance Use Disorders to Recovery Services in Real Time.‚Äù ([MU News](https://miamioh.edu/news/2022/06/the-wrap-up-may.html))

On July 15, 2022, a Formative Report was provided to the ODHE.

>  Currently peer support case workers use a facebook group and carry a binder to find placements in recovery houses. Some houses (particularly for-profit houses) send emails daily to case managers on a list serv to update the number of available beds. Case managers tell clients about the houses, but reported that clients do not feel like they have much choice. Case workers underscored how this app would allow them to quickly narrow down options to a couple of potential houses for their clients, enabling those clients or their advocates to visually weigh the options, make choices, and directly contact the house within the app.

On January 23, 2023, Highwire Brand Studio had its first day of class. Led by:
- Dr. Tim Greenlee, Professor, Department of Marketing
- Christy Carr, Assistant Teaching Professor, Communication Design
- Michael Bailey-Van Kuren, Ph.D., Associate Professor and Chair Emerging Technology in Business

AORs:
- Marketing Plan: Greenlee
- Prototype and Beta App: Bailey-Van Kuren

On the first day, they put us into groups to come up with a list of names, without much explanation. The name and logo they had used for two years was denied by legal.

Items on the syllabus include:
- Market analysis presentation (Mon, Feb 27 ‚Äì Wed, Mar 1)
- Market strategy presentation (Mon, Apr 3)
- Tactical execution presentation (Mon, Apr 17 ‚Äì Wed, Apr 19)
- Final presentation (Wed, May 3)

~Between late February and March 1st, [Seven Hills Technology](https://sevenhillstechnology.com/) selected as app partner.

## Project challenges

See [business challenges](/business-challenges) for a broader overview of challenges.

Two core challenges:
1. An atomic network that can grow on its own
2. An accessible service that all can use

A directory is a [two-sided network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market) subject to [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect), or [allee effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allee_effect). Network effects are destructive when starting‚Äînew networks regress to zero. At the start, this project is subject to the [Cold Start Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start_(recommender_systems)).

Reaching critical mass from a cold start is a major challenge for this project.

> There are usually a minority of users that will create disproportionate value and as a result, they will have disproportionate power. This the ‚ÄúHard Side‚Äù of your network. They do more work, contribute more to your network, but are that much harder to acquire and retain. For social networks, these are often the content creators that generate the media everyone consumes. For app stores, these are the developers that actually create the products. For workplace apps, these are the managers that author and create documents and projects, and who invite coworkers to participate. For marketplaces, these are usually the sellers and providers who spend their entire day attracting users with their products and services.
>
> [The Cold Start Problem, Andrew Chen](https://andrewchen.com/solve-a-hard-problem-cold-start-problem/)

Questions to hypothesize:
- Who is the hard side of your network and how will they use the product?
- How do they first hear about the app, and in what context?
- As the network grows, why will people on the hard side come back?
- What makes the hard side sticky to the network such that when a new network emerges, they will retain on the product?

**The hard side of this network is residential mental health and substance abuse facilities.**

This directory could lean into the [Rich Barton Playbook](https://kwokchain.com/2019/04/09/making-uncommon-knowledge-common/)‚Äîwin markets with products that make uncommon knowledge common. Focus on becoming the authoritative public source on a subject at scale and low cost. High quality pages unique for each listing for an SEO land grab.

[FindTreatment.gov](https://findtreatment.gov/locator/details?U2FsdGVkX19qOSOYOSb61wsx6mC/Xpha3Nb8DJwNebUkiijkG+OAkZk13WTxU97vJynBn3CLt/onJRDWt29HwMvoiPsqekQlhsJBkU1KqX8flzgd99l/947OEQl5CtIKfQg0OvIrMbqr2TkxGR6zaySfXlKqfQ7kHtkEB0h1bRs=) has _extremely_ authoritative pages for listings. However, these pages lack even basic structured metadata (dev: what are you even using react helmet for??).


## Treatment facility directories

Service core

- **Network:** The service must have the smallest possible network that is stable and can grow on its own
- **Accessible:** The service must be more accessible than alternatives
    - The goal is access for all
    - [WCAG: Four principles of accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility)
        1. The information must be perceivable to them
        2. The information must be understandable to them
        3. The interface must be operable
        4. The interface must be robust

## Background on Recovery Housing

Recovery housing is for:
- People who struggle with addiction
- People in addiction recovery
- People leaving residential treatment programs (after addiction program, before returning home)
- People without a home
- People leaving the criminal justice system
- People with mental health issues

Recovery housing is a housing environment that is free from alcohol and illicit drug use and offers peer support, connection to treatment, recovery supports, and other associated supports in the community.

Example recovery home: [Talbert House](https://www.talberthouse.org/help/)

Recovery housing is a [type of treatment](https://findtreatment.gov/what-to-expect/treatment#Types%20of%20Treatment) among:
- Supervised withdrawal from substance use (detox)
- Daily medication and emergency counseling (interim care)
- Treatment at a program site while a patient lives on their own (outpatient)
    - See [NAICS: 621420, Outpatient mental health and substance abuse centers](#621420-outpatient-mental-health-and-substance-abuse-centers)
- 24/7 care connected to a hospital, lasting days or weeks (hospital inpatient)
    - See [NAICS: 622210, Psychiatric and substance abuse hospitals](#622210-psychiatric-and-substance-abuse-hospitals)
- Live-in care, lasting for one month to one year (residential)
    - See [NAICS: 623220, Residential mental health and substance abuse facilities](#623220-residential-mental-health-and-substance-abuse-facilities)
    - See [NAICS: 623990, Other residential care facilities](#623990-other-residential-care-facilities)
- A temporary space to stay while transitioning from an intensive treatment setting. Sometimes called a halfway house or sober living facility. (transitional housing)
    - See [NAICS: 624221, Temporary shelters](#624221-temporary-shelters)
    - See [NAICS: 624229, Other community housing services](#624229-other-community-housing-services)
- Integrated care that addresses substance use and mental illness
- Care given over the phone or online to support treatment and recovery (telemedicine)

The categorization of housing is not standardized across the US. Some states do have category standards.

(2018) [OhioMHAS: Ohio housing categories and definitions](https://mha.ohio.gov/static/Portals/0/assets/SchoolsAndCommunities/CommunityAndHousing/HousingResources/Housing-Definitions_122018.pdf)

OhioMHAS lists four housing categories (confirm):
1. Permanent housing
    - Private apartments
    - Permanent supportive housing (PSI)
    - Recovery residence
2. Residential care
    - Child residential care/group home
    - Residential facility
    - Assisted living
3. Temporary
    - Foster care (adult or child)
    - Homeless emergency shelter
    - Respite care
    - Temporary housing
    - Transitional housing
4. Residential treatment
    - Crisis care
    - Detox
    - Residential facility class 1 (residential treatment mental health)
    - Recovery residence Level 4 (residential treatment substance use)

Here are steps someone might take to find themselves in recovery housing from [Substance Use Disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health): [What happens next?](https://findtreatment.gov/what-to-expect/treatment#What%20Happens%20Next?)

Seeking help ‚Üí Assessment ‚Üí Detox ‚Üí Rehabilitation ‚Üí Aftercare ‚Üí Ongoing support

1. **Seeking help**: The first step is to admit that there is a problem and to seek help. This could involve talking to a trusted friend or family member, seeing a doctor or mental health professional, or reaching out to a local support group.
2. **Assessment**: A professional will conduct an assessment to determine the extent of the substance use disorder and to develop a treatment plan.
3. **Detox**: Depending on the severity of the addiction, a medically supervised withdrawal may be necessary to help the individual safely withdraw from the substance they are using as withdrawal can be so severe that people hallucinate, have convulsions, or develop other dangerous conditions. Detox can take place on a regular medical ward of a hospital, in a specialized inpatient detoxification unit, or on an outpatient basis with close medical supervision. Detoxification may take several days to a week or more.
4. **Rehabilitation**: After detox, the individual may enter a rehabilitation program where they receive treatment and support for their addiction. This could involve individual or group therapy, counseling, and participation in support groups.
5. **Aftercare**: Upon completion of the rehabilitation program, the individual may transition to recovery housing where they can continue to receive support as they work on their recovery.
6. **Ongoing support**: It is important for the individual to continue to attend support groups, therapy sessions, and to have a strong support network as they work on their ongoing recovery.

People with SUD (Substance Use Disorder) can find recovery homes through several ways, including:

- Referrals from healthcare providers: Doctors, therapists, or other healthcare providers may know about recovery homes in the area and can make a referral.
- Online resources: There are websites and online directories that list recovery homes and provide information about their services and locations.
- Support groups: Support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous may have information about recovery homes in the area.
- Hotlines: Substance abuse hotlines can provide information about recovery homes and help connect individuals with appropriate resources.
- Community organizations: Community organizations such as churches or non-profits may have information about recovery homes and can provide referrals.

See [NAICS 62322: Residential mental health and substance abuse facilities](#623220-residential-mental-health-and-substance-abuse-facilities)

## Mental health and substance use disorder treatment

### [Who provides care?](https://findtreatment.gov/what-to-expect/treatment#Who%20Provides%20Care?)

## Opioid Treatment Programs

In the United States, the use of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in opioid treatment programs (OTPs) is governed by the [Certification of Opioid Treatment Programs, 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 8](https://www.govregs.com/regulations/expand/title42_chapterI_part8_subpartC_section8.12).

The regulation created a system to certify and accredit OTPs, allowing them to administer and dispense FDA-approved medications. In addition, opioid use disorder (OUD) patients receiving these medications also receive counseling and other behavioral therapies to provide patients with a whole-person approach.

An OTP can help connect individuals with recovery housing options in their community, and may have established relationships with local recovery housing providers. The OTP staff can also help the individual navigate the process of securing housing, including identifying funding sources or other resources that may be available to support their transition.

### [Medications for Substance Use Disorders](https://www.samhsa.gov/medications-substance-use-disorders)

FDA has approved several different medications to treat alcohol use disorders (AUD) and opioid use disorders (OUD). These medications relieve the withdrawal symptoms and psychological cravings that cause chemical imbalances in the body. Medications used are evidence-based treatment options and do not just substitute one drug for another.

**Medications for Alcohol Use Disorder (MAUD)**

Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone are the most common medications used to treat alcohol use disorder. They do not provide a cure for the disorder but are most effective for people who participate in a treatment program.

**Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)**

Buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone are the most common medications used to treat OUD. These medications operate to normalize brain chemistry, block the euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids, relieve physiological cravings, and normalize body functions without the negative and euphoric effects of the substance used.

Buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone are used to treat OUD to short-acting opioids such as heroin, morphine, and codeine, as well as semi-synthetic opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone. These medications are safe to use for months, years, or even a lifetime.

[IBISWorld competitive landscape](https://my-ibisworld-com.proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/us/en/industry/62221/competitive-landscape)

Key success factors

- Accreditation with the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations can enhance reputation, attract staff and help to gain access to private and government insurance reimbursement programs.
- Access to highly skilled workforce
- Hospitals located close to referring doctors and the general population are in a stronger position to attract patients.
- Larger hospital operators can spread fixed costs over a greater number of patients, thereby improving profitability.

Competition in psychiatric hospital services is relatively low due to high fragmentation and growing demand for services.

#### OhioMHAS [certified peer supporters](https://mha.ohio.gov/community-partners/peer-supporters)

A certified peer supporter is someone who has direct lived experience with behavioral health challenges, or someone who has navigated services on behalf of an individual with behavioral health challenges. Certified peer supporters are trained and certified in using their lived experience to help others  impacted by  mental illness or substance use disorders. Ohio offers three types of Peer Supporter certification: Adult, Family, and Youth/Young Adult.

> Five peer organizations have partnered with OhioPRO and OhioMHAS to create technical assistance call centers for peers. These centers will be staffed by certified peer recovery supporters who will be available to answer any questions regarding the new eLicensing platform. They have received training so that they may provide information and answer any questions related to peer recovery supporter certification or recertification.

### (2000) [SAMHSA: Comprehensive Case Management for Substance Abuse Treatment (TIP: Treatment Improvement Protocol)](https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/d7/priv/sma15-4215.pdf)

Although it defies precise definition, case management generally can be described as a coordinated approach to the delivery of health, substance abuse, mental health, and social services, linking clients with appropriate services to address specific needs and achieve stated goals.

Two reasons why case management is effective as an adjunct to substance abuse treatment:
1. Retention in treatment is associated with better outcomes, and a principal goal of case management is to keep clients engaged in treatment and moving toward recovery.
2. Treatment may be more likely to succeed when a client‚Äôs other problems are address concurrently with substance abuse.

A treatment professional utilizing case management will:
- Provide the client a single point of contact for multiple health and social services systems
- Advocate for the client
- Be flexible, community-based, and client-oriented
- Assist the client with needs generally thought to be outside the realm of substance abuse treatment

A treatment professional should possess particular knowledge, skills, and attitudes including:
- Understanding various models and theories of addiction and other problems related to substance abuse
- Describe philosophies, practices, policies, and outcomes of models of treatment, recovery, relapse prevention, and continuing care for addiction and other substance-related problems
- Recognize importance of family, social networks, community systems, and self-help groups in the treatment and recovery process
- Understanding available insurance and health maintenance options and importance of access
- Understanding diverse cultures and incorporating the relevant needs of culturally diverse groups, as well as people with disabilities, into clinical practice
- Understanding the value of an interdisciplinary approach to addiction treatment

Substance abuse treatment and case management functions differ in that treatment involves activities that help substance abusers recognize their problems, acquire the motivation and tools to stay abstinent, and use the acquired tools; case management focuses on helping the substance abuser acquire needed resources.

In the field of substance abuse, three interagency models have been identified.
1. Single agency model: case manager personally establishes a series of distinct relationships on an as-needed basis with counterparts in other agencies.
2. Informal partnership model: staff members from several agencies work as a collaborative team, often constituted case by case
3. Formal consortium: binds case managers and service providers through formal written agreements.

Many communities have published directories of social, health, welfare, housing, vocational, and other service organizations to help case management programs identify resources, possible provider linkages, and potential gaps in services for their clients. Although such directories are a good starting point, it is important to follow up on the listings to ensure they are still accurate and will be of use to the client.

Substance abuse treatment programs, including those that receive public funding, are increasingly operating in a managed care environment. In such an environment, policy and clinical decision making rely on outcome data that traditionally describe the impact of case management and substance abuse treatment interventions in the context of services used and money spent.

Treatment programs may undertake case-finding activities through formal liaisons with potential referral sources such as employers, law enforcement authorities, public welfare agencies, acute emergency medical care facilities, and managed care companies. Health maintenance organizations and managed care companies often require case finding when hotlines are called. General media campaigns and word of mouth also lead substance abusers to contact treatment programs.

Some treatment programs operate aggressive outreach street programs to identify and engage clients. Outreach workers contact prospective clients and offer to facilitate their entry into treatment. Although treatment admission may be the foremost goal of the worker and the treatment program, prospective clients frequently have other requests before agreeing to participate. Much of the assistance offered by outreach workers resembles case management in that it is community-based, responds to an immediate client need, and is pragmatic.

### (2018) [GAO: Information on Recovery Housing Prevalence, Selected States' Oversight, and Funding](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/691302.pdf)

Contents:
- Nationwide prevalence of recovery housing is unknown, but national organizations collect data on the number and characteristics of a subset of recovery homes
- Most states we reviewed have investigated potential fraud related to recovery housing and taken steps to enhance oversight
- Certain SAMHSA grant funding can be used for recovery housing, and selected states have used SAMHSA and state funding to support recovery housing

Fraudulent activities identified by state investigators included schemes in which recovery housing operators recruited individuals with SUD to specific recovery homes and treatment providers, who then billed patients‚Äô insurance for extensive and unnecessary drug testing for the purposes of profit. For example, officials from the Florida state attorney‚Äôs office told GAO that SUD treatment providers were paying $300 to $500 or more per week to recovery housing operators for every patient they referred for treatment and were billing patients‚Äô insurance for hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnecessary drug testing over the course of several months. Some of these investigations have resulted in arrests and other actions, such as changes to insurance payment policies.

### (2020-04-20) [Interact For Health: Recovery Housing Gap Analysis](https://www.interactforhealth.org/upl/media/recovery_housing_gap_analysis.pdf)

Some states have accrediting or certifying bodies for recovery housing:
- [Ohio Recovery Housing](https://www.ohiorecoveryhousing.org) (ORH)
- [Indiana National Alliance for Recovery Residences](https://inarr.org) (INARR)

Ohio‚Äôs population is multiples larger than Indiana and Kentucky combined.

3. Supervised: 8 houses, 87 beds (avg 10 beds/house)
4. Service provider: 16 houses, 256 beds (avg 16 beds/house)
5. Unknown: 13 houses, 17 beds (avg 1 bed/house)

Annual estimate of adults who receive SUD treatment in Ohio: 10,660

Summary statistics from Greater Cincinnati region:
- Total houses: 103
- Certified houses: 22 (21%)
- Total beds: 1,259
- Total staff: 228

### (07-15-2022) Finding Recovery: ODHE formative report

Finding Recovery is a project developing a downloadable cell-phone application (app) to fill the current gap in recovery support services.

Identified target audience: recovery house managers, peer support case workers, and family members.

Currently peer support case workers use a facebook group and carry a binder to find placements in recovery houses. Some houses (particularly for-profit houses) send emails daily to case managers on a list serv to update the number of available beds. Case managers tell clients about the houses, but reported that clients do not feel like they have much choice. Case workers underscored how this app would allow them to quickly narrow down options to a couple of potential houses for their clients, enabling those clients or their advocates to visually weigh the options, make choices, and directly contact the house within the app.

Identified most important filters useful for peer support case workers and family members to search for best potential fit recovery houses on behalf of people seeking recovery housing.

Identified most important attributes about houses to help narrow the options and that recovery house managers have found are of key importance to maximizing the likelihood that someone will ‚Äúfit‚Äù with the house.

Account for differences in recovery house resources, so that houses can choose whether they want to live update bed availability.

The two respondents who were unsure voiced concerns about accessibility to people who are homeless, concerns about protection of privacy of clients who were in recovery, and concerns that family members who used the app might not understand the language (e.g. the difference between recovery houses that have clinical treatment components and those that do not).

Recovery house managers are excited that this app would save them time advertising their house to case workers and filling beds with people who are most likely going to do well in their house (‚Äúfit‚Äù). Case workers are excited that this app would save them time and help them better assist clients in making choices regarding recovery houses. The few family members we talked to thought that this app would help parents feel a bit more informed about recovery houses and how to find them.

Make the transitions into recovery housing easier, more efficient, and not dependent upon who one knows in the recovery world.
