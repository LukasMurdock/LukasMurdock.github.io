tl;dr: A team of researchers and professors received a grant from the Ohio Department of Higher Education to develop “a downloadable cell-phone ready application” to help people with substance use disorders and their family members find suitable recovery placement options. In addition, the app will provide information on the availability, qualifications, and potential fit of different recovery facilities. The project will last 18 months and involve partnerships with multiple organizations and stakeholders to ensure the app meets the community’s needs.

[Interact for Health](https://interactforhealth.org/) focuses on reducing tobacco use, addressing the opioid epidemic and ensuring that children have access to health care through school-based health centers. They are an independent foundation that serves 20 counties in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana.

M. Cameron Hay, Professor of Anthropology at Miami University, and Abbe Lackmeyer prepared the report “[Recovery Housing Gap Analysis](https://www.interactforhealth.org/upl/media/recovery_housing_gap_analysis.pdf)” for Interact for Health on April 30, 2020.

A proposal was made in 2021 to the ODHE ([Ohio Department of Higher Education](https://highered.ohio.gov/about)).

> As a transdisciplinary team of researchers and professors, we propose to develop a downloadable cell-phone ready application (app) to enable people with substance use disorders and their family members to initiate evidence-based care by finding recovery placement options with up-to-date availability, needed qualifications, and potential fit information.
> […]
> We propose an 18 month project […] to enable people seeking recovery and their family members to easily find and match with available placements with recovery services. This project will be measured by a reduction in reported time and stress it takes to find placement in a recovery house, and a reduction in reported time and stress in filling empty beds at recovery houses.

Phases:
1. Identify characteristics and challenges of the potential app
2. Spring 2022 IMS 351 designs app prototype
3. Summer 2022 GHS 201 tests app prototype
4. Fall 2022 IMS 440 develops app beta
5. Winter 2022 App development tech company finalizes app
6. Spring 2023 Highwire Brand Studio develops marketing campaign for app
7. May 2023 deliver app, business plan, and marketing plan

## Background on Recovery Housing

Recovery housing is for:
- People who struggle with addiction
- People in addiction recovery
- People leaving residential treatment programs (after addiction program, before returning home)
- People without a home
- People leaving the criminal justice system
- People with mental health issues

Recovery housing is a housing environment that is free from alcohol and illicit drug use and offers peer support, connection to treatment, recovery supports, and other associated supports in the community.

Example recovery home: [Talbert House](https://www.talberthouse.org/help/)

Recovery housing is a [type of treatment](https://findtreatment.gov/what-to-expect/treatment#Types%20of%20Treatment) among:
- Supervised withdrawal from substance use (detox)
- Daily medication and emergency counseling (interim care)
- Treatment at a program site while a patient lives on their own (outpatient)
- 24/7 care connected to a hospital, lasting days or weeks (hospital inpatient)
- Live-in care, lasting for one month to one year (residential)
- A temporary space to stay while transitioning from an intensive treatment setting. Sometimes called a halfway house or sober living facility. (transitional housing)
- Integrated care that addresses substance use and mental illness
- Care given over the phone or online to support treatment and recovery (telemedicine)

The categorization of housing is not standardized across the US. Some states do have category standards.

Here are steps someone might take to find themselves in recovery housing from [Substance Use Disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health): [What happens next?](https://findtreatment.gov/what-to-expect/treatment#What%20Happens%20Next?)

Seeking help → Assessment → Detox → Rehabilitation → Aftercare → Ongoing support

1. **Seeking help**: The first step is to admit that there is a problem and to seek help. This could involve talking to a trusted friend or family member, seeing a doctor or mental health professional, or reaching out to a local support group.
2. **Assessment**: A professional will conduct an assessment to determine the extent of the substance use disorder and to develop a treatment plan.
3. **Detox**: Depending on the severity of the addiction, a medically supervised withdrawal may be necessary to help the individual safely withdraw from the substance they are using as withdrawal can be so severe that people hallucinate, have convulsions, or develop other dangerous conditions. Detox can take place on a regular medical ward of a hospital, in a specialized inpatient detoxification unit, or on an outpatient basis with close medical supervision. Detoxification may take several days to a week or more.
4. **Rehabilitation**: After detox, the individual may enter a rehabilitation program where they receive treatment and support for their addiction. This could involve individual or group therapy, counseling, and participation in support groups.
5. **Aftercare**: Upon completion of the rehabilitation program, the individual may transition to recovery housing where they can continue to receive support as they work on their recovery.
6. **Ongoing support**: It is important for the individual to continue to attend support groups, therapy sessions, and to have a strong support network as they work on their ongoing recovery.

People with SUD (Substance Use Disorder) can find recovery homes through several ways, including:

- Referrals from healthcare providers: Doctors, therapists, or other healthcare providers may know about recovery homes in the area and can make a referral.
- Online resources: There are websites and online directories that list recovery homes and provide information about their services and locations.
- Support groups: Support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous may have information about recovery homes in the area.
- Hotlines: Substance abuse hotlines can provide information about recovery homes and help connect individuals with appropriate resources.
- Community organizations: Community organizations such as churches or non-profits may have information about recovery homes and can provide referrals.

## Organizations

### (2018) [GAO: Information on Recovery Housing Prevalence, Selected States' Oversight, and Funding](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/691302.pdf)

Contents:
- Nationwide prevalence of recovery housing is unknown, but national organizations collect data on the number and characteristics of a subset of recovery homes
- Most states we reviewed have investigated potential fraud related to recovery housing and taken steps to enhance oversight
- Certain SAMHSA grant funding can be used for recovery housing, and selected states have used SAMHSA and state funding to support recovery housing

Fraudulent activities identified by state investigators included schemes in which recovery housing operators recruited individuals with SUD to specific recovery homes and treatment providers, who then billed patients’ insurance for extensive and unnecessary drug testing for the purposes of profit. For example, officials from the Florida state attorney’s office told GAO that SUD treatment providers were paying $300 to $500 or more per week to recovery housing operators for every patient they referred for treatment and were billing patients’ insurance for hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnecessary drug testing over the course of several months. Some of these investigations have resulted in arrests and other actions, such as changes to insurance payment policies.

3. Supervised: 8 houses, 87 beds (avg 10 beds/house)
4. Service provider: 16 houses, 256 beds (avg 16 beds/house)
5. Unknown: 13 houses, 17 beds (avg 1 bed/house)

Annual estimate of adults who receive SUD treatment in Ohio: 10,660

Summary statistics from Greater Cincinnati region:
- Total houses: 103
- Certified houses: 22 (21%)
- Total beds: 1,259
- Total staff: 228
