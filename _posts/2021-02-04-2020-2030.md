> Life is not a dress rehearsal—this is probably it.  Make it count. ([The days are long but the decades are short](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short))

This was spurred on by the work of [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short), [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/), and countless others.

## Life goals
- Get a job sustainable enough for positive cashflow and nest egg building
- Move into apartment
	- Move into apartment outside of college
- Marry

Everything feels up in the air right now. I’m still at the *start*, and the mist in front of me heavily obscures my vision.

## Predictions

Inspired by [Long Bets](https://longbets.org/), [Prediction Book](https://predictionbook.com/), and [Jeff Bezos](https://fs.blog/2018/11/staying-the-same/).

What’s going to change? What’s not going to change?

- Phones will not significantly evolve and will remain [pictures on glass](http://worrydream.com/#!/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign). (2010–2020 saw larger displays, thinner bezels, removal of physical buttons, more cameras, and more power, but no change in how we interact.)
- No device will fully replace the smartphone—we’ll still be carrying them around.
- Wearables will become the new frontier
	- VR gear will become part of the larger culture
		- A [metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse) created mostly by/for the youth will be the growth loop of VR adoption.
		- VR gear won’t have significantly more interactivity than what we see today. Only sight and sound information.
	- AR gear will become part of the larger culture.
		- AR usage will still be mostly niche and business applications.
- There will be no *physical* war-waging on or from the United States that widely captivates citizen attention.
- There will be some form of large-scale attack on the US in either Space or Cyber domain that captivates citizen attention.

- There will not be a collective celebration from United States citizens on any matter.
- Approval will shift from brick-and-mortar Universities to education provided by individuals and companies.


I think the larger take is I don’t expect a collective citizenry from the United States. It’s fractured, and I expect it to become more so.

My final predictions.
- The US empire will continue to decline in power.
- As other nations citizenry get online, wealth and power will shift away from the US.
