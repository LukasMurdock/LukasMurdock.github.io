The norm seems to only act once you’re told. No one cares to do anything until they’re told what to do by the teacher. And if they have questions—it’s straight back to the teacher. Learning became a means to an end. Why do we learn? We learn to pass the test. Nothing more, nothing less.

> The university, in a society ruled by public opinion, was to have been an island of intellectual freedom where all views were investigated without restriction.”
<span style="font-size: 12px;">Saul Bellow, Introduction to *The Closing of the American Mind*</span>

Nobody challenges what they are told. And trying to will get you shut out from having any opinion at all within the group. Only caring about what they’re told to care about by everyone else.

>They are little able to defend their experience, which had seemed unquestionable until questioned, and it is most resistant to cool analysis. Yet if a student can—and this is most difficult and unusual—draw back, get a critical distance on what he clings to, come to doubt the ultimate value of what he loves, he has taken the first and most difficult step toward the philosophic conversion. Indignation is the soul’s defense against the wound of doubt about its own; it reorders the cosmos to support the justice of its cause. It justifies putting Socrates to death. Recognizing indignation for what it is constitutes knowledge of the soul, and is thus an experience more philosophic than the study of mathematics.”
*The Closing of the American Mind*

It seems as if people operate with the minimum viable effort. My first semester in University has been one of the most intellectually draining experiences of my life.

>Education in our times must try to find whatever there is in students that might yearn for completion, and to reconstruct the learning that would enable them autonomously to seek that completion.” *The Closing of the American Mind*

We’re letting ourselves down by waiting for instruction. Became obsessed with forward motion in making positive change happen that you’re proud of. Do that and you’ll often find yourself face-first against the waves of normality.

We learn what we do, not what we’re told. What can you do today?
