Humanity seems cursed to spend forever reaching for things just out of reach. But the real curse is that we don’t need those things.

Diogenes, a Greek philosopher and one of the founders of Cynic philosophy, believed in self-control. The importance of high moral standards and the rejection of life’s non-necessities. His beliefs rejected personal possessions and ideas like social status. His sole possession was a cup before he saw a boy drinking water with his hands. He threw the cup away realizing he had been born with two fine cups attached to his body.

He viewed manners and etiquette as parts of the false life and should not be indulged in.

Alexander the Great was very interested in meeting him. He found Diogenes resting in the sunlight, introduced himself, and asked if there was anything he could do for him. Diogenes replied, "Yes. Get out of my sunlight." 

Alexander the Great admired his spirit and said, "If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes" to which Diogenes replied, "If I were not Diogenes, I would also wish to be Diogenes."

When we choose to settle with ourselves we choose to acknowledge ourselves. To stop reaching for things out of reach.
