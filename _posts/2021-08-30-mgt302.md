**Efficiency**: doing something at the lowest possible cost.

**Effectiveness**: doing the right things to create the most value for the customer.

**Value**: the attractiveness of a product relative to its price.

Efficiency measures:

- Cash conversion cycle = Days sales outstanding + Days inventory - Payable period

- Receivables turnover = Annual credit sales / Average AR
- Inventory turnover = COGS / Average inventory value
- Asset turnover = Revenue / Total assets

**Just-in-time (JIT)**: Using minimal inventories of parts that arrive exactly when they are needed.

**Total quality control (TQC)**: aggressively eliminates causes of production defects.

**Lean manufacturing**: refers to both JIT and TQC.

**Total quality management (TQM)**: Managing for all dimensions of products and services important to the customer.

**Six Sigma**: describes a quality goal of no more than 3.4 defects out of every million units. Also refers to a quality improvement philosophy and program.
