## What is React?

1. React is a JavaScript library.
2. JavaScript is for making websites interactive.
3. The React JS library is an open-source (created and maintained by Facebook) to handle complex state management and UI updates.
4. React allows you to more easily handle state changes and have the UI *react* accordingly.

You don’t *need* React. But, it’s what job descriptions call for—at least for now. It’s up to you to pick up the phone every time it rings.

## What do you need to know to learn React?

I mean, the true answer is *nothing*. I started learning React with an:
- High level of knowledge about HTML
- Moderate level of knowledge about CSS
- Moderate level of knowledge about JS

React is a JavaScript library. If you’ve done projects with vanilla JavaScript and understand what HTML and CSS do, learning React is mostly learning the new *process*.

I also apparently know enough JS to be dangerous, but not enough, so I’m still quite confused.

React, like code, is an *ever-changing, ephemeral beast*. In the Beginner’s Guide to React, Kent says “this was so common, the React team created […],” so many times. React seems to effectively rewrite itself every few years or so.

I mistakenly thought that React was more than it is.
