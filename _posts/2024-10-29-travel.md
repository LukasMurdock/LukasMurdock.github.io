## Security

### iPhone

- Ensure [Find My](https://support.apple.com/find-my) is enabled
    - Go to Settings > [your name] > Find My > Find my iPhone
    - Turn on Find My iPhone
    - Turn on Find My Network
    - Turn on Send Last Location
- Enable [Stolen Device Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/120340)
    - Go to Settings, then tap Face ID & Passcode.
    - Enter your device passcode.
    - Tap Stolen Device Protection, then turn Stolen Device Protection on.
- Disable Control Center and Siri access when device is locked
    - Go to Settings, then tap Face ID & Passcode.
    - Scroll down to “allow access when locked”
    - Turn Control Center off
    - Turn Siri off

#### Temporarily Disable Face ID

-  Press and hold the side button and either volume button

Once you do this, your iPhone will require your passcode to unlock. You can’t use Face ID or Touch ID to unlock until after you’ve unlocked with your passcode. That means even if someone confiscates your phone by force, they cannot unlock it by pointing it at your face or by forcing your finger onto the Touch ID sensor. Put your iPhone into this mode every time you’re separated from it.
