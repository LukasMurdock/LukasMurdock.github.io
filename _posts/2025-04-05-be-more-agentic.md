> [agent (n.)](https://www.etymonline.com/word/agent)
>
> late 15c., "one who acts," from Latin agentem (nominative agens) "effective, powerful," present participle of agere "to set in motion, drive forward; to do, perform; keep in movement" (from PIE root *ag- "to drive, draw out or forth, move").

## [High agency](https://www.highagency.com/)

> You wake up in a 3rd world jail cell. You’re only allowed to call one person you know to get you out of there. Who do you call?
>
> […]
>
> It’s a combination of three distinct skills rarely found together:
>
> 1. Clear thinking
> 2. Bias to action
> 3. Disagreeability
>
> It's impossible to imagine someone breaking you out of a 3rd world jail cell without all three.
>
> If they can't think clearly, they will charge ahead with the first bad plan that pops into their head.
>
> If they lack a bias for action, they'll never move their ideas from theory into the real world.
>
> If they aren't disagreeable, they'll quit and conform when someone in authority tells them "No".

## [Do what makes the best story](https://amasad.me/story)

> Life is a form of self storytelling. We're continually retelling ourselves our life story, but very few people think of themselves as authors of their story, not mere subjects. People with extraordinary high-agency realize this early in life and start maximizing the interestingness of their life story.
>
> Having a fascinating life story is not just an exercise in vanity -- it has a real impact on your success in life. You'll have an easier time attracting friends as well as life and business partners. It'll also make it much easier to sell yourself or your products. It has a kind of compounding halo effect
>
> […]
>
> So next time you're faced with a tough decision, consider the path that makes a more interesting story. If it turned out to be the wrong decision to have made, you'd at least be fun at dinner parties.

## [How to be more agentic](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/how-to-be-more-agentic)

> radical agency is about finding real edges: things you are willing to do that others aren’t, often because they’re annoying or unpleasant. These don’t always surface in awareness to the point one is actually choosing -- often they live in a cloud of aversion that strategically obscures the tradeoff.

> Ask for things. Ask for things that feel unreasonable, to make sure your intuitions about what’s reasonable are accurate (of course, try not to be a jerk in the process). If you’re only asking for things you get, you’re not aiming high enough.

> If you aren’t trying to get real feedback from people who know you, you’re cooking without tasting. This is, like, the lowest hanging fruit for self-improvement, but few people really try to pick it.

> meet as many people doing related work

> Most subject matter is learnable, even stuff that seems really hard. But beyond that, many (most?) traits that people treat as fixed are actually quite malleable if you (1) believe they are and (2) put the same kind of work into learning them as you would anything else.

> making changes in your life, especially when learning new skill sets, requires you to cross a moat of low status, a period of time where you are actually bad at the thing or fail to know things that are obvious to other people. It’s called a moat both because you can’t just leap to the other side and because it gives anyone who can cross it a real advantage.

> Burnout is the ultimate agency-killer. This is so true that I’ve learned to identify a reduction in agency as one of the first signs of burnout, one that shows up even before I consciously realize what’s happening. A switch flips and I start looking for ways to rule out ideas and actions, to conclude they won’t work or aren’t necessary, rather than chasing better versions.
