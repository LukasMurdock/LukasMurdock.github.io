## What is React?

1. React is a JavaScript library.
2. JavaScript is for making websites interactive.
3. The React JS library is an open-source (created and maintained by Facebook) to handle complex state management and UI updates.
4. React allows you to more easily handle state changes and have the UI *react* accordingly.

## What do you need to know to learn React?

I mean, the true answer is *nothing*. I started learning React with an:
- High level of knowledge about HTML
- Moderate level of knowledge about CSS
- Moderate level of knowledge about JS

React is a JavaScript library. If you’ve done projects with vanilla JavaScript and understand what HTML and CSS do, learning React is mostly learning the new *process*.

I also apparently know enough JS to be dangerous, but not enough, so I’m still quite confused.

React, like code, is an *ever-changing, ephemeral beast*. In the Beginner’s Guide to React, Kent says “this was so common, the React team created […],” so many times. React seems to have effectively rewritten itself every few years or so.

I mistakenly thought that React was more than it is.

## What is React

- JSX
- React Components
- React Hooks
    - `useState` state in React components
    - `useReducer` consolidate state update logic in a reducer
    - `useEffect` specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself (yeah, confusing)
    - `useRef` DOM interaction
    - `useContext` read and subscribe to context from your component
