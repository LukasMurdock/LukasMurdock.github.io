## What is React?

1. React is a JavaScript library.
2. JavaScript is for making websites interactive.
3. The React JS library is an open-source (created and maintained by Facebook) to handle complex state management and UI updates.
4. React allows you to more easily handle state changes and have the UI *react* accordingly.

You don’t *need* React. But, it’s what job descriptions call for—at least for now. It’s up to you to pick up the phone every time it rings.

## What do you need to know to learn React?

I mean, the true answer is *nothing*. I started learning React with an:
- High level of knowledge about HTML
- Moderate level of knowledge about CSS
- Moderate level of knowledge about JS

React is a JavaScript library. If you’ve done projects with vanilla JavaScript and understand what HTML and CSS do, learning React is mostly learning the new *process*.

I also apparently know enough JS to be dangerous, but not enough, so I’m still quite confused.

React, like code, is an *ever-changing, ephemeral beast*. In the Beginner’s Guide to React, Kent says “this was so common, the React team created […],” so many times. React seems to effectively rewrite itself every few years or so.

I mistakenly thought that React was more than it is.# Occasional Work Search
Money is required.

In my case, searching for work is made arduous by seeking a position with the opportunity to ratchet up continuously—work that compounds itself into valuable expertise. But I have my pitfalls yet to be accounted for.

I foresee my priorities in the next 20 years (2040 here we come) to look somewhat like this:
1. Get a job
2. Pay down debts
3. Save

Until kids show up and throw a wrench into two and three, my ability to find a good-enough job *as soon as possible* severely impacts how much of two and three I’ll be able to do effectively.

But I’m stuck in a catch-22. Your power and opportunity reside in your ability to say no to more things than you say yes, but you can’t know what you want to say yes to until you gain experience.

So how can you create the optimal conditions for lucky things to happen to you?

**Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.**

**Do more things, and tell more people about it**.

**Communicate problems, communicate solutions**.

**Help people move people forward**.

**Generate proof-of-work**.

**Turn on lights for people**.

**Make eyes-light-up**.

**Show up**.

**Partake**.

Okay, but what should you focus on? I came up with my own buckets of Designer, Developer, and Marketer. But what do I focus on now?

I have the best connections and touch within the development route; I could go all-in on development and move into *tech*. But to me, code is merely a middleman for the solution. So, while the high-end tech market is hot and likely will be for the next 20 years, I see the bottom-end continuously eaten away at low-code or no-code solutions.

Design suffers from similar interchangeability, albeit not wholly. Design has gained increasing importance in recent years yet still strife with those looking at the result and thinking, *that’s so easy, I could do that*.

Marketing is the broadest bucket of all. It’s also where I’m leaning towards the most—working to surface and communicate problems and solutions. But what are those positions?

That’s what nearly all three suffer from—my lack of experience in the field. More notable is my lack of communication with *anyone at all* as I spend my days alone in my room reading books, articles, taking courses, and wandering around online. I’m a member of various online circles, but I mostly stay out of sight—and therefore, out of mind.

So the question becomes, how do I get into the minds of the right people? Who are the right people? The people who can grant me a position to connect with others and grow.

The people you pick, pick your future. Decide on those acknowledging your value with money and eagerness to pay it, then that’s the life that you signed up for.

Because I don’t often connect with others, I don’t know what value I bring. I can assume I have value to bring, but I don’t know how to sell it. Which cancels out any value I could bring.

But such worry gets me nowhere and opportunities don’t visit caves. Again, I need to create my own luck.

**What are you going to do about it?**

**Whatever scares you, go do it.**

The obvious answer, **show up**.
