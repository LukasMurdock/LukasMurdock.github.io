## Inventions and Discoveries
One of my most profound epiphany's is the realization that I am just two years younger than Google. For me Google represents a style of living I can't imagine living without—*and I have never lived without it.* Being able to have seemingly everything at your fingertips with just a thought away is absolutely miraculous. But there are other things within our daily lives that we never think about living without. And yet just a few parents and grandparents ago, they didn't exist.

You should remember to take a step back and gain perspective from time to time. To obtain true understanding of the relative importance of things around you.

Here is a timeline of human things to try to help with some perspective of how far we’ve come. Be aware that technology often spans many decades of theoretical work, development, and production. *So dates and people may be wrong.*

## Moving into the future
Woah, shouldn't there be more notable things of the last decade? Yes, and if you feel like this list is lacking something, feel free to [contact me here and let me know.](/contact/)

As science advances, technology becomes more and more outside the realm of common understanding. Many innovative improvements being made in fields don't mean anything to me as I'm not specialized in that specific field. And a lot of “innovations” we see is technology that has already been around for decades. Now that doesn't mean I'm not excited to see VR and AI take over every field, but these inventions aren't necessarily new, more of they're being applied. 

For example the first working AI programs were developed in 1951 by Christopher Strachey and Dietrich Prinz, while the first VR headset was created in 1968 by Ivan Sutherland and Bob Sproull, and the first autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s. None of these technologies are quite like what we have today but they are the earliest parts of the idea put in application.

Ideas spread through society in cycles, sometimes seemingly randomly taking off in a storm. Hopefully you were able to look back and imagine life without the things we use without a second thought.
