It comes with it.

- Go into the Jekyll `_data` directory 
- `gem install sqlite3`
- In the `_plugins` directory run `gem install sqlite3`
- Add `gem 'sqlite3'` to Gemfile in `_plugins`?
- Create a new `.rb` file in the `_plugins` directory, in my case I named it `database.rb` 
- Run `chmod +x database.rb` to allow terminal to execute the Ruby script?

Add `require 'sqlite3'`
