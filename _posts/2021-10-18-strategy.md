Strategy comes from French _stratégie_, the “art of a general” and the Greek _strategia_, the "office or command of a general".

The general is the commander of an army, thus strategy is the art and science of military command.

Strategy is a set of specific choices made with the intent to win a battle.

Tactics are specific actions to achieve your strategic goals.
