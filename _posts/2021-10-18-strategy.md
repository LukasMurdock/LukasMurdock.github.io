Strategy is how your beliefs inform your approach. Tactics are specific actions you take to improve your outcomes.

Strategy comes from French _stratégie_, the “art of a general” and the Greek _strategia_, the "office or command of a general".

The general is the commander of an army, thus strategy is the art and science of military command.

Strategy is a set of specific choices made with the intent to win a battle.

Tactics are specific actions to achieve your strategic goals.

Are you focusing on the future and not getting dragged into immediate-term concerns?

Which resource allocation choices will your work dictate, and are you making that clear to others?

Are you clear about how the company can win, what it will take to win, and are you articulating this compellingly?

Can people articulate why decisions are being made or the intent they’re meant to support?

[Alfred Chandler's 1962 definitions of Strategy, Structure, and Tactics](https://www.amazon.com/Strategy-Structure-Chapters-Industrial-Enterprise/dp/158798198X):
- Strategy: The plan for the allocation of resources to anticipated demand.
- Structure: The design for putting the enterprise’s existing resources against current demand.
- Tactics: The efficient and steady use of current resources whose allocation had already been decided.

> Fast learns, slow remembers.  Fast proposes, slow disposes.  Fast is discontinuous, slow is continuous.  Fast and small instructs slow and big by accrued innovation and by occasional revolution.  Slow and big controls small and fast by constraint and constancy.  Fast gets all our attention, slow has all the power.
