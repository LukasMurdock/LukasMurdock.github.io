## Scales of culture

From [_The Culture Map_](https://erinmeyer.com/books/the-culture-map/) by Erin Meyer

1. Communicating: low-context vs. high-context
2. Evaluating: direct negative feedback vs. indirect negative feedback
3. Persuading: principles-first vs. applications first
4. Leading: egalitarian vs. hierarchical
5. Deciding: consensual vs. top-down
6. Trusting: task-based vs. relationship-based
7. Disagreeing: confrontational vs. avoids confrontation
8. Scheduling: linear-time vs. flexible-time

### Good faith vs Bad faith


| Good faith                                           | Bad faith                                                  |

| Attempt to find shared base realities and values     | No attempt to find shared base realities and values        |
| Emergence of new positions, integrations, and nuance | Emergence of stalemates, polarization, and simplifications |

### Wait vs Interrupt

- Do not interrupt (vs) Interrupt when you understand
- Speak briefly (vs) Speak until I interrupt
- Use physical cues to indicate understanding and desire to speak (vs) Use physical cues to indicate when I should continue talking


|                                    | I interrupt                    | I wait for you to finish          |
|:-----------------------------------|:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| I let you interrupt                | **The Church of Interruption** | The Meek                          |
| I will say my piece no matter what | Barkers                        | **The Church of Strong Civility** |


### Asynchronous first vs Synchronous first

- Do not expect an immediate response (vs) Expect an immediate response
- Respond on your own time (vs) Must be present to respond
- Respond when it works best for you (vs) Everyone is tied to the same schedule


### Reveal vs Infer

- When you want something I trust you to ask for it (vs) When you want something I trust you will give me hints to notice and interpret.
- If I make a request that doesn’t make sense to you, I trust you to refuse it (vs) I trust you to notice my hints to what I want and provide or offer it if possible.

### Explicit vs Implicit

- State what may be obvious, but is often not to everyone (vs) Holding back statement that seem obvious to you, but may not be obvious to everyone else
- Focus on reducing ambiguity (vs) Do not focus on reducing ambiguity


## Confidence level

For expressions of likelihood or probability, use one of the following sets of
terms. Source:
[Intelligence Community Directives 203: Analytic Standards](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD-203_TA_Analytic_Standards_21_Dec_2022.pdf)

| Probability Term    | Synonym                 | Percentage Range |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| almost no chance    | remote                  | 01-05%           |
| very unlikely       | highly improbable       | 05-20%           |
| unlikely            | improbable (improbably) | 20-45%           |
| roughly even chance | roughly even odds       | 45-55%           |
| likely              | probable (probably)     | 55-80%           |
| very likely         | highly probable         | 80-95%           |
| almost certain(ly)  | nearly certain          | 95-99%           |

Note causes of uncertainty ( e.g., type, currency, and amount of information,
knowledge gaps, and the nature of the issue) and explain how uncertainties
affect analysis (e.g., to what degree and how a judgment depends on assumptions)

## Scales of communication needs

From [diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/)

- Acquisition vs Application
- Action vs Cognition

| need          | addressed in  | the user             | the documentation |
|:--------------|:--------------|:---------------------|:------------------|
| learning      | tutorials     | acquires their craft | informs action    |
| goals         | how-to guides | applies their craft  | informs action    |
| information   | reference     | applies their craft  | informs cognition |
| understanding | explanation   | acquires their craft | informs cognition |
