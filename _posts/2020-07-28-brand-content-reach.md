Every business has three core needs: **brand, content, and reach**.

1. **No brand:** no internal direction or reason for anyone to care.
2. **No content:** no way for anyone to learn about your story.
3. **No reach:** no one to find your content.

Businesses start with building a brand, then building out content, and then going for reach.

Customers and [true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) work the other way. They come across you through reach efforts, make their way through your content, and become fans of your brand.
