Every business has three core needs: **brand, content, and reach**.

I relate a part of the development of this framework to my own development across design, development, and marketing. While not explicitly equivalent, brand has a lot of focus on design, content has a lot of focus on development, and reach has a lot of focus on marketing.

It’s not that much of a stretch to refer to these three pillars as such:
1. **Brand Design**
2. **Content Development**
3. **Reach Marketing**

Although, I feel the additional verbiage detracts from the simplicity of brand, content, and reach.

1. **No brand:** no internal direction or reason for anyone to care.
2. **No content:** no way for anyone to learn about your story.
3. **No reach:** no one to find your content.

Businesses start by building a brand, then build out content, and then go for reach.

Customers and [true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) work start this framework at the other end. They come across you through reach, then they make their way through your content, and then become fans of your brand.


## What’s part of your Brand?
- A story worth telling
- Messaging/positioning
- Reviews
- Logo/identity design
- Iconography
- Design system

## What’s part of your Content?
- Website
- Social media posts
- Blog posts
- Photography
- Videography
- Illustration

## What’s part of your Reach?
- Word-of-mouth
- Shares
- Links
- Funnels
- Ads

Within this framework, there is a third factor that acts not as a pillar but as the base of the other three pillars. And that base is **support**.

## What’s part of your Support?
- Tracking/analytics
- Hiring
- Training/coaching


## What does successful Brand, Content, and Reach look like?
The best way to sell to, brand, persuade, or inspire people is to condense your idea down to [Two Words](https://www.swyx.io/two-words/). Thus I will try to encapsulate what success looks like for each of these pillars within two words.

1. **Successful Brand results in a consistent vision.**
2. **Successful Content results in getting the attention of the right people.**
3. **Successful Reach results in the change you seek to make.**
