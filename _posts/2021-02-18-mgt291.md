## Module 1

Organizational Behavior is a field of study of human behavior for improving an organizations effectiveness.

---

**Four basic management functions**:
1. **Planning**: setting goals, establishing strategy to pursue goals, forecasting future threats/opportunities
2. **Organizing**: designing organization's structure, identifying tasks that need to be done, hiring, delegating tasks, creating a chain of command, rules of communication
3. **Leading**: directing/coordinating the work of others, influencing, motivating, maintaining morale, resolving individual group conflicts
4. **Controlling**: monitoring performance, taking appropriate actions to get back on track

---

**Three management skills**:

- Helps you become a more effective employee/manager
- Organizations benefit as a whole

---

**Define "independent variable" and "dependent variable".**

---

Moderator → “when to work” dependent situation

Mediator → “why it works” explanatory mechanism

---

**Common dependent variables**: productivity, creativity, dysfunctional behaviors, work attitudes

**Common independent variables**: individual level (personality, motivation), group level (leadership, work team), organization level (HR policies)

---

**Scientific Management** → management to principles of efficiency derived from experiments in methods of work and production, especially from time-and-motion studies to find the “one best way”

**Four Principles of Scientific Management**:
1. Science, Not Rule of Thumb
2. Harmony, Not Discord
3. Cooperation, Not Individualism
4. Development of Each and Every Person to His / Her Greatest Efficiency and Prosperity

---

**Hawthorn effect** → we preform better when people are watching

---

**Human Relations Movement** → workers are not essentially interchangeable parts motivated solely by money

**The System Perspective:** Organization is a system of elements and environment functioning as a whole

- Shows importance of workplace environment
- Focuses on flow and interaction of workplace elements

**Contingency**/**Situational Perspective**: Situations and outcomes are based on many variables

**Universal Perspective**: presumes a direct cause-and-effect linkage between variables

---

**Organizational citizenship**: behavior positive to contribution outside strict requirements of the job

**Dysfunctional behaviors**: organizational performance detracting behaviors

---

**“Scientific Method” steps**:
1. Theory
2. Hypothesis
3. Data
4. Verification

---

2. Prejudice (preconceived notions)
3. Perceived threat of loss
4. “Like me” bias (tribal, we like those who are like us)
5. Unequal access to organization networks

---

**Reciprocal mentoring** → pair senior with junior employees

---

**Discrimination** → employment decisions are not job related 

---

**Affirmative Action** → **reactively** correct past injustice

Misconceptions: people don’t know the criteria

**Equal employment opportunity (EEO) legislation** → **proactively** prevent discrimination
- Civil Rights Act (Title VII) → employment race, color, sex, religion, and origin
- Age Discrimination in Employment Act → 40+ age, no retirement required
- Pregnancy Discrimination Act
- American with Disabilities Act → essentially qualified
    - What is reasonable accomodation?

---

**Diversity Management Program** → 

1. Education
2. Enforcement
3. Exposure

---

1. Discrimination and Fairness Paradigm
    - Demographic based, denies difference
    - “*All the same. Differences don‘t matter.*”
2. Access and Legitimacy Paradigm
    - Demographic based, isolated differences
3. Learning and Effectiveness Paradigm
    - Demographics and psychographics
    - “*With our differences”*

---

**IBM four pillars of change**:
1. Leadership support
2. Employee engagement
3. Integral management practices
4. Linked to business goals

---

### “Why Most Diversity Programs Fail”

**Main reason for failure of diversity programs**: Efforts can make things worse. Most focus on controlling manager’s behaviors that approach tends to activate bias

**Three tools for Effective Diversity Programs**:

1. **Engagement**: prompt them to act in ways that support a particular view, their opinions can shift toward that view
2. **Contact**: ex: whites fighting alongside blacks came to see them as soldiers first and foremost
3. **Social Accountability**: plays on need to look good in the eyes around us; ex: discuss grades with peers can lead to judging work based on quality
