Marketing and sales are two sides of the same coin–helping people move forward by generously showing up to solve their problems.

Marketers understand the feelings of those they seek to serve and look to serve them better. Aside from the actual need-to-buy category, what we buy isn’t products. We buy emotional change.

What’s your promise? What change do you seek to make? How are you helping the people you seek to serve move forward through that change?

How are you [optimizing the perception](https://lukasmurdock.com/perception-optimization/) of it all?

Because the best story wins. Not the best idea. Not the right answer. Just whoever tells a story that catches people’s attention and gets them to nod their heads.

> What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence. The question is what can you make people believe you have done.

Good branding means one or both of the following:
- Affective Valence: customers with built-up positive associations with a brand (are willing to/want to) pay more for brand products compared to other brands.
- Uncertainty Reduction: customers with trust in their expectations of a brand pay more compared to other brands.


## Where change happens
Much of the difference between the [marketing types](https://lukasmurdock.com/marketing-differentiation/) come down to different amounts of [attention](https://lukasmurdock.com/attention/).

Reaching, helping someone move forward, or browsing social media will be relatively different from someone reading their email and even more different from someone attending an event. Different spaces garner different [Perception Optimization](https://lukasmurdock.com/perception-optimization/) specialists. Sure, there is going to be overlap; it’s all helping people move forward. Same strategy; sometimes tactics differ.

## Poets

The chain of thought started with Bards.

[Websters 1913](https://www.websters1913.com/words/Bard):
> A professional poet and singer, as among the ancient Celts, whose occupation was to compose and sing verses in honor of the heroic achievements of princes and brave men.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard):
> a professional story teller, verse-maker, music composer, oral historian and genealogist, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or noble) to commemorate one or more of the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own activities.

Bards were *poets*.

[Websters 1913](https://www.websters1913.com/words/Poet): an imaginative thinker or writer.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet):
> The work of a poet is essentially one of communication, either expressing ideas in a literal sense, such as writing about a specific event or place, or metaphorically.

Marketing is about [narrative propagation](https://lukasmurdock.com/idea-virus). Creating durable narratives—and the most durable narratives are the ones that address our deepest needs and desires.

Simplicity spreads better, complexity sells better. Complexity designates authority through signals of effort.

# Marketing Strategy

## [Powers](https://lukasmurdock.com/power/)
Good businesses have high profit margins. High profit margins bring competitors willing to reduce prices. Competition drives down prices and margins. Power, here, is defined as a moat designed to maintain profit margins–a power against margin compression.

- Scale economies (per unit cost declines as production volume increases)
- Network economies (product value increases with increases in customers)
- Counter-positioning (competitors anticipate mimicking your offering would damage their existing business and do not mimic)
- Switching costs (customers switching brings financial, procedural, or relational costs)
- Branding (affective valence and uncertainty reduction)
- Cornered resource (idiosyncratic arbitrage—superior access to a coveted asset)
- Process (culture enabled lower costs and/or superior product)

## Opportunities (controllable inputs)
- Content opportunities
- Collaboration opportunities
- Monetization opportunities

## Strategy Influences

### Branding Influences
- Reciprocity
- Consistency
- Social proof
- Attraction
- Authority
- Scarcity
- Unity (“us”)

### Content Influences
- Cohort → different content opportunities due to network effects (e.g., team activities, groups have more content opportunities than individuals)

### Collaboration Influences
- Classification → different collaboration opportunities due to [inferential differences](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/inferential-distance) and production method differences.
- Location → different collaboration opportunities due to location differences

### Monetization Influences
- Audience size → different monetization opportunities due to demand differences and economies of scale (e.g., branded merchandise makes less sense with little customers)
