Marketing and sales are two sides of the same coin–helping people move forward by generously showing up to solve their problems.

Marketers understand the feelings of those they seek to serve and look to serve them better. Aside from the actual need-to-buy category, what we buy isn’t products. We buy emotional change.

What’s your promise? What change do you seek to make? How are you helping the people you seek to serve move forward through that change?

How are you [optimizing the perception](https://lukasmurdock.com/perception-optimization/) of it all?

Because the best story wins. Not the best idea. Not the right answer. Just whoever tells a story that catches people’s attention and gets them to nod their heads.

## Where change happens
Much of the difference between the [marketing types](https://lukasmurdock.com/marketing-differentiation/) come down to different amounts of [attention](https://lukasmurdock.com/attention/).

Reaching, helping someone move forward, or browsing social media will be relatively different from someone reading their email and even more different from someone attending an event. Different spaces garner different [Perception Optimization](https://lukasmurdock.com/perception-optimization/) specialists. Sure, there is going to be overlap; it’s all helping people move forward. Same strategy; sometimes tactics differ.

## Poets

The chain of thought started with Bards.

[Websters 1913](https://www.websters1913.com/words/Bard):
> A professional poet and singer, as among the ancient Celts, whose occupation was to compose and sing verses in honor of the heroic achievements of princes and brave men.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard):
> a professional story teller, verse-maker, music composer, oral historian and genealogist, employed by a patron (such as a monarch or noble) to commemorate one or more of the patron's ancestors and to praise the patron's own activities.

Bards were *poets*.

[Websters 1913](https://www.websters1913.com/words/Poet): an imaginative thinker or writer.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet):
> The work of a poet is essentially one of communication, either expressing ideas in a literal sense, such as writing about a specific event or place, or metaphorically.

Marketing is about narrative propagation. Creating durable narratives—and the most durable narratives are the ones that address our deepest needs and desires.
