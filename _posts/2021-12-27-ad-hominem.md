Paul Graham’s Hierarchy of Disagreement, from How to Disagree:
0. “You’re an idiot” (Name calling)
1. “Of course he would say that. He's a senator.” (Ad Hominem)
2. “I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion.” (Responding to Tone)
3. “I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion. Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific theory.” (Contradiction)
4. Counterargument
5. Refutation
6. Refuting the Central Point

Insulting one’s character is a common example of a fallacious ad hominem—only when used in place of a *genuine* argument.
