I’ve been in love with [Klim Type Foundry](https://klim.co.nz/) ever since first stumbling upon their fonts. I brought [Domaine Display](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/domaine-display/) and [Calibre](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/calibre/) to the attention of the team at [Infinite Smiles](https://www.infinitesmiles.com/) and we finalized them into the rebranding campaign.

Interestingly the new fonts are not listed anywhere on the [System Fonts developer page](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/system-fonts/#downloadable) yet. But you can find them listed in a [support document for Fonts in macOS Catalina](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210192).

Font highlights are:
- Domaine Display from Klim Type Foundry
- Founders Grotesk by Klim Type Foundry
- Canela from Commercial Type
- Graphik by Commercial Type
- Produkt by Commercial Type
- Publico by Commercial Type
- Proxima Nova by Mark Simonson Studio

I love the attention Apple gives on providing users better fonts and arguably a better out of the box experience.
