## 2021

So far, the work has been splitting keeping up with school work with building the website and portal for Virra with React/Next.js.

Average day in 2021 looks like checking:
- Email
- Slack
- Checking on iOS
    - YouTube
    - NetNewsWire
    - Readwise
    - HackerNews

Summer ideas:
- Read a buncho books
- Clean up laptop after school
- Do a project with Three.js
- Write more about web design and development
- Explore email marketing
- Google [Data Analytics Course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) or [others](https://grow.google/certificates/)


## 2020
We’re gonna start this and hopefully not forget about it.

**(Edit)** after getting this idea I’ve decided on making some changes to this site including:
1. Changelog
2. Add more complete dates to data (e.g. When I finished a book)
3. Add "Want to read" book list
4. What I’m subscribed to (Newsletters & RSS)
5. Sections to measure reading, writing, speaking, and exercise (What I want to optimize for)
6. Listing "[Alive time](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/robert-greene/)" — where I pushed myself to learn and act every day
