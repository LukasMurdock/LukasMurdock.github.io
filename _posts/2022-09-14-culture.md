> if I were to suggest some criteria for a superior narrative, they would be:
> It is externally oriented. Itâ€™s about who the customer becomes, not what the company does.
> It functions as belief-driven business logic. It uses carefully considered counter-orthodox beliefs to govern choices across product, strategy, people, and capital, not just storytelling.
> It meaningfully differentiates. It justifies unique systems, activities, and experiences that competitors canâ€™t easily copy.
> It creates strategic coherence. Teams align without being controlled, as the narrative guides distributed teams in a singular direction.
> It is future-permissioning. It authorizes moves others canâ€™t make, because they do not yet have the benefit of reverse engineering the logic and counter-orthodox beliefs encapsulated by your unique narrative.
