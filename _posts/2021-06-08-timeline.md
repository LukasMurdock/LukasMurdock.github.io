I started this timeline as a [reflection of years as I neared my last of being a teenager](https://lukasmurdock.com/zero-through-nineteen/).

Here I’ll try to keep a timeline of events I find meaningful at the time, because looking back those events are easily lost.

Again, I’m really bad with dates. And school years go between years but we’re just going to ignore that.


## Platform Progression

I find this notable. What a time to be alive.

## 2007 First coding experience
My Uncle showed me Ruby on Rails, but I couldn’t wrap my head around it at the time. (Date sourced from my Heroku account.) He introduced me to HTML and CSS, and I started to build small projects, but it took too much time to create simple things at first, so I quickly grew bored.

## 2012 First social media
Must have received my first Apple Laptop (mid-2011 13-inch MacBook Air) around this time as well.

Joined Twitter in December 2012. Seems notable. I’m the type of guy to create a Twitter account in 2012 but not post _anything_ until 2015-2016.

Also created a Github account.

## 2013 Created YouTube/Google? Account
Google acquired YouTube so I’m not sure about the account structure and I’ll just attribute this to when I first signed up for YouTube.

Some favorite channels of the time:
- FilmRiot
- Corridor Digital
- Sam and Niko (now Corridor Crew)
- Ryan Higa


## 2014 8th Grade
In 8th grade, I was a part of the i3STEM Program, and my first, like “official relationship” or whatever, started.

The Ti-84 calculator gave way to my first genuine coding interest: [BASIC on the Ti-84](http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/commands). I was on my calculator so much that my history teacher took away my calculator.

Used Final Cut Pro and Motion 5 to make [Punkin Chunkin class video](https://youtu.be/dIzMk6twmmg).

Started working at Chick-Fil-A.

**Personal Records:**
- Cross Country (2-mile): 11:04 (avg 5:32/mile)
- High Jump: 5ft 6in

## 2015 9th Grade (First year of High School)

I programmed lock screens on my jailbroken iPhone 5s with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (rip LockHTML).

My first, like “official relationship” or whatever, ended.

**Personal Records:**
- Cross Country (5K, 3.1 miles): 17:26 (avg 5:37/mile)
- High Jump: 5ft 8in

## 2016 10th Grade

**Videos made with Final Cut Pro:**
- [German video](https://youtu.be/0-DnpiqkT6I)
- [Interdisciplinary 10 video](https://youtu.be/0-DnpiqkT6I)
- [Interdisciplinary 10 video](https://youtu.be/rf25eUj_L7o)
- Vote for shaw video

Quit working at Chick-Fil-A (on the spot. [People leave managers, not companies](https://www.intercom.com/blog/people-leave-managers-not-companies/).)

Decided to do volleyball instead of track (alongside Max and Ronny).

## 2017 11th Grade
Built my own computer. Took AP Psychology and AP Micro/Macro Economics.

The summer reading for AP Psych was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. It’s the first book on my book list because I view this book and class as a propitious moment to come across this information.

Started dating Sabrina.
