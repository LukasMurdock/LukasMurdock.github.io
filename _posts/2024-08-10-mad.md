Love the quick profit, the annual raise,  \
vacation with pay. Want more  \
of everything ready-made. Be afraid  \
to know your neighbors and to die.  \
And you will have a window in your head.  \
Not even your future will be a mystery  \
any more. Your mind will be punched in a card  \
and shut away in a little drawer.  \
When they want you to buy something  \
they will call you. When they want you  \
to die for profit they will let you know.

So, friends, every day do something  \
that won't compute. Love the Lord.  \
Love the world. Work for nothing.  \
Take all that you have and be poor.  \
Love someone who does not deserve it.  \
Denounce the government and embrace  \
the flag. Hope to live in that free  \
republic for which it stands.  \
Give your approval to all you cannot  \
understand. Praise ignorance, for what man  \
has not encountered he has not destroyed.

Ask the questions that have no answers.  \
Invest in the millennium. Plant sequoias.  \
Say that your main crop is the forest  \
that you did not plant,  \
that you will not live to harvest.  \
Say that the leaves are harvested  \
when they have rotted into the mold.  \
Call that profit. Prophesy such returns.

Put your faith in the two inches of humus  \
that will build under the trees  \
every thousand years.  \
Listen to carrion - put your ear  \
close, and hear the faint chattering  \
of the songs that are to come.  \
Expect the end of the world. Laugh.  \
Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful  \
though you have considered all the facts.  \
So long as women do not go cheap  \
for power, please women more than men.  \
Ask yourself: Will this satisfy  \
a woman satisfied to bear a child?  \
Will this disturb the sleep  \
of a woman near to giving birth?

Go with your love to the fields.  \
Lie down in the shade. Rest your head  \
in her lap. Swear allegiance  \
to what is nighest your thoughts.  \
As soon as the generals and the politicos  \
can predict the motions of your mind,  \
lose it. Leave it as a sign  \
to mark the false trail, the way  \
you didn't go. Be like the fox  \
who makes more tracks than necessary,  \
some in the wrong direction.  \
Practice resurrection.
