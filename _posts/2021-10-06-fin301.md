#### Multiple Cash Flows

Variables:
- L1: investments
- L2: accrued years
- R: rate (potentially L3, if it changes between years)

Equations:
- FV = PV * (1+rate)^year
    - `sum( seq( L1(I) * (1+R) ^ (I-1), I, 1, dim(L1) ) )`
- PV = FV / (1+rate)^year
    - `sum( seq( L1(I) / (1+R) ^ (I-1), I, 1, dim(L1) ) )`

#### Annuities
Variables:
- Present Value Annuity (PV Annuity)
- Dollars in Period
- Rate
- Periods

Equations:
- presentValueAnnuity = dollarsInPeriod * ((1- (1 / ((1+ rate) ^ periods))) / rate)
- dollarsInPeriod = presentValueAnnuity / ((1- (1 / ((1+ rate) ^ periods))) / rate)


## Chapter 1: Introduction to Corporate Finance
Finance is making decisions to maximize value to owners.

Value is driven by cash flows, not income.



## Key equations
### Chapter 2: Financial statements, taxes and cash flow


- $$assets = {liabilities + shareholdersEquity}$$
- $$income = revenues - expenses$$
- $$cashFlowFromAssets = cashFlowToCreditors + cashFlowToStockholders$$
    - $$cashFlowFromAssets = operatingCashFlow (OCF) - netCapitalSpending - changeInNetWorkingCapital (NWC)$$
    - $$operatingCashFlow = EBIT + depreciation - taxes$$
    - $$netCapitalSpending = endingNetFixedAssets - beginningNetFixedAssets + depreciation$$
    - $$changeInNetWorkingCapital = endingNWC - beginningNWC$$
- $$cashFlowToCreditors = interestPaid - netNewBorrowing$$
- $$cashFlowToStockholders = dividendsPaid - netNewEquityRaised$$
- The ratio of net working capital to total assets:
    - $$netWorkingCapitalToTotalAssets = {netWorkingCapital \over{totalAssets}}$$
- The interval measure:
    - $$intervalMeasure = {currentAssets \over{averageDailyOperatingCosts}}$$
- The total debt ratio:
    - $$totalDebtRatio = {totalAssets - totalEquity \over{totalAssets}}$$
- The debt-equity ratio:
    - $$debtEquityRatio = {totalDebt \over{totalEquity}}$$
- The equity multiplier:
    - $$equityMultiplier = {totalAssets \over{equityMultiplier}}$$
- The long-term debt ratio:
    - $$longTermDebtRatio = {longTermDebt \over{longTermDebt + totalEquity}}$$
- The times interest earned (TIE) ratio:
    - $$timesInterestEarnedRatio = {EBIT \over{interest}}$$
- The cash coverage ratio:
    - $$cashCoverageRatio = {EBIT + deprecation \over{interest}}$$

## Chapter 7: Interest rates and bond valuation

### Bond valuation formula
- rate (r) = Coupon Rate (annual or semiannual)
- time (t) = periods to maturity
- C = dollarCouponPayment (annual or semiannual)

$$price = {couponPV + faceValuePV}$$

$$price = {\left( C \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^t}}} \over{r}}\right)}  + {faceValue \over{(1+r)^t}}$$


### Bond valuation
- Equity ≈ ownership
- Bond ≈ loan, with legal claim to future cashflows

### Bond features
- **Bond**: loan, debt
- **Coupons**: promised interest payments
- **Face Value**: promised repayment amount (par value, maturity value)
- **Coupon Rate**: $${annualDollarCoupon \over{faceValue}}$$
- **Maturity**: years until face value is paid

### Bond values and yields
- Cashflows of a bond: coupons and faceValue
    - To find market price: discount cashflows at market discount rate
- Cashflows of a bond are fixed
    - Market interest rates change ▶ discount rate changes ▶ price of bond changes (PV)
- Two cashflow components to a bond
    - Annuity (level coupons)
    - Lump sum (faceValue)
- YieldToMaturity (YTM): required market rate on a bond
    - Bond “discount rate,” or “yield”

### Bond example

A corporation issues a bond with 10 years to maturity. The bond has an annual coupon of $80, and a face value of $1,000. Similar bonds in the market have a YTM of 8%. What is the price of the bond? What is the coupon rate?

Steps:
1. Draw cashflow timeline
2. Calculate present value (PV) of coupon payments (using annuity formula)
3. Calculate present value (PV) of face value payment
4. Calculate the total bond price
5. Calculate the coupon rate

Step 2: Calculate present value (PV) of coupon payments with annuity formula:

$$PVA = {coupon \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^t}}} \over{r}}}$$

$$ $536.81 = {80 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1.08)^10}}} \over{.08}}}$$

Step 3: Calculate present value (PV) of face value payment

$$presentValue = {facevalue \over{(1+r)^t}}$$

$$463.19 = {$1000 \over{(1.08)^10 }}$$

Step 4: Calculate the total bond price

$$price = {$536.81 + $463.19} = $1000$$

Step 5: Calculate the coupon rate

$$couponRate = {annualDollarCoupon \over{faceValue}}$$

$$.08 = {$80 \over{$1000}} = 8\% $$

As couponRate = yieldToMaturity (YTM), this is a “Par Bond,” implying the price of the bond = faceValue—a unique case.

Now, a year passes in our above example and the company now has nine years until maturity and the market interest rate has risen by 10%. What is the new bond price? What is the relationship between couponRate, yieldToMaturity, and price?

- time (t) = 9
- rate (r) = .10

Step 2: Calculate present value (PV) of coupon payments with annuity formula:

$$PVA = {coupon \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^t}}} \over{r}}}$$

$$460.72 = {80 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1.10)^9}}} \over{9}}}$$

Step 3: Calculate present value (PV) of face value payment

$$presentValue = {facevalue \over{(1+r)^t}}$$

$$424.10 = {1000 \over{(1.10)^9}}$$

Step 4: Calculate the total bond price

$$price = {couponPV + faceValuePV}$$

$$price = {$460.72 + $424.10} = $884.85$$

The coupon rate has not changed; however, yieldToMaturity has.

As couponRate (8%) < yieldToMaturity (YTM) (10%), this is a “Discount Bond,” a bond that sells for less than its face value.

What if the market interest rate had fallen to 6% instead of rising to 10%?

$$price = {couponPV + faceValuePV}$$

$$price = {\left( 80 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1.06)^9}}} \over{.06}}\right)}  + {1000 \over{(1.06)^9}}$$

$$1136.04 = {544.14 + 591.90}$$

As couponRate (8%) > yieldToMaturity (YTM) (6%), this is a “Premium bond,” a bond that sells for more than its face value.

### Bond values
- **Par Value Bond**: a bond that sells for its face value
- **Discount Bond**: a bond that sells for less than its face value
- **Premium Bond**: a bond that sells for more than its face value
- **Coupon rate**:  $${annualDollarCoupon \over{faceValue}}$$

#### YTM vs. Price
As yieldToMaturity (YTM) increases, bond price decreases—an inverse relation.

#### Interest Rate vs. Bond Value (Interest rate risk)
- Longer maturity time means greater interest rate risk.
    - As maturity increases the change in interest rate is magnified.
    - Like the effect of lump sum payments as time increases
- Lower the coupon rate means greater interest rate risk.
    - A bond with a lower coupon rate has more of its value built into lump sum payment at maturity.
    - As the coupon rate and present value (PV) of lump sum changes this effect is larger on the bond value for a lower coupon bond.

### Solving for yieldToMaturity (YTM)
Calculate the YTM for a 6 year, 8% coupon bond (annual payments), price = $955.14, faceValue = $1,000.

- couponRate = $${annualDollarCoupon \over{faceValue}}$$
- 8% = $${annualDollarCoupon \over{1000}}$$ , annualDollarCoupon = 80

$$price = {\left( C \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^t}}} \over{r}}\right)}  + {faceValue \over{(1+r)^t}}$$

$$955.14 = {\left( $80 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^6}}} \over{r}}\right)}  + {1000 \over{(1+r)^6}}, r = .09 $$

### Bond values: Semiannual Coupons

- Semiannual bonds make coupon payments twice a year
- Adjustments
    - Halve annual coupon payment
    - Halve quoted yieldToMaturity (YTM)
    - Double period years (t)

For example, what is the price of a bond with an 11% coupon rate that makes semiannual payments for 20 years at a YTM of 13%? How does the price compare to a bond that makes annual coupon payments?


- couponRate = $${annualDollarCoupon \over{faceValue}}$$
- 11% = $${annualDollarCoupon \over{1000}}$$ , annualDollarCoupon = 110

- Semiannual Adjustments
    - Halve annual coupon payment, Semiannual coupon payment = $${110 \over{2}}$$ = $55
    - Halve quoted yieldToMaturity (YTM) (r), $${.13 \over{2}}$$ = $.065
    - Double period years (t), 20 * 2 = 40

$$price = {\left( C \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^t}}} \over{r}}\right)}  + {faceValue \over{(1+r)^t}}$$

$$price = {\left( $55 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1.065)^{40}}}} \over{.065}}\right)}  + {1000 \over{(1.065)^{40}}} = $858.54 $$

If we had annual payments:

$$price = {\left( $110 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1.13)^{20}}}} \over{.13}}\right)}  + {1000 \over{(1.13)^{20}}} = $859.51 $$

---

effectiveAnnualRate (EAR) = $${1 + {yieldToMaturity \over{2}}^{2}}$$

effectiveAnnualRate (EAR) = $${1 + {.13 \over{2}}^{2}}$$ = .1342 (13.42%)

effectiveAnnualRate (EAR) 13.42% > yieldToMaturity (YTM) 13%, anytime we have compounding frequency greater than once a year, the EAR > YTM.

### Bond features
- Characteristics of debt securities
    - Creditors (lenders) generally have no voting rights
    - Payment of interest on debt is a tax deductible business expense
    - Unpaid debt is a liability, subjects the firm to legal action if they default.

As equity is ownership, equity holders are paid after debt holders.

- Short-term debt: under 1 year to maturity
- Long-term debt: more than 1 year to maturity

The legal written agreement between borrower and lender is a _bond indenture_.

- Registered form: ownership is recorded, payment direction to owner of record.
- Bearer form: payment made to holder, the bearer, of bond—no record of owner.

Security, debt classified by collateral:
- Mortgage securities: bonds are backs by mortgage on real property.
- Debenture: unsecured debt with no collateral with greater than 10 years maturity.
- Note: unsecured debt with less than 10 years maturity.

Seniority, order of precedence claims:
    - Senior vs subordinated debt

Repayment, early repayment is typical:
    - Sinking fund, early redemption

Call provision, allows issue to call or repurchase part or all of the issue:
    - Callable in 10 years (10 years of call protection)

Protective covenants, limiting actions of the firm
    - Negative covenant — “shall not…” (e.g., merger)
    - Positive covenant — “shall…” (e.g., maintain collateral)

Government bonds:
- Issued by U.S. Treasury
- No default risk
- Treasury bills are bonds less than one year to maturity, “risk free rate”
- Treasury notes are bonds with 2-10 year maturities
- Treasury bonds are bonds with up to 30 year maturities
- Interest exempt from state taxes

Corporate bonds:
- Issued by corporations
- Have default risk, or credit risk
- Callable and convertible
- Secure and unsecured (“debentures”)

Municipal bonds — “Munis”:
- Issued by state and local governments
    - School districts, hospitals, universities
- Varying degrees of default risk
- Interest income (coupons) are exempt from federal taxes, and often state and local taxes
- Attractive to investors in high tax brackets
- Because of tax exemption, yields are lower than comparable taxable bonds
    - Need to make a conversion to compare _taxEquivalentYield_ (TEY)
    - $$muniTaxEquivalentYield = {taxFreeYieldToMaturity \over{1 - taxRate}}$$

Example:
- AA corporate bond yield = 6.6%
- AA municipal bond yield = 4.8%
- In a 35% tax bracket, the AA municipal bond is a better investment as the muniTaxEquivalentYield = $${4.8 \over{1 - .35}}$$ = 7.38%
- In a 22% tax bracket, the AA corporate bond is a better investment as the municipal bond muniTaxEquivalentYield = $${4.8 \over{1 - .22}}$$ = 6.15%


Zero coupon bonds:
    - No coupon payments
    - Deep discount bonds are bonds with a price much lower than faceValue
    - Long-term zero coupon bonds have very high interest rate risk
        - Generally, lower coupons and high maturity = more interest rate risk

Example:
- Zero coupon bond with $1,000 faceValue, 12% YTM, and 5 years to maturity. What is the price of this bond?

$$price = {couponPV + faceValuePV}$$

$$price = { 1000 \over{(1+.12)^{5}}} = $567.43$$

A deep discount bond.

### Bond ratings
Bond ratings assess the creditworthiness of the issuer
- Assesses the issuers ability to make principal and interest payments
- Bond ratings, or credit ratings, are only concerned with default risk
    - Not a measure of interest rate risk
    - One could have a highly rated bond with significant interest rate risk

### Bond markets
Bond trading volume is significantly higher than stock trading volume; U.S. Treasury bonds are one of the highest volume security markets.
- Many more bond issues than stock issues
- A company can have multiple bond issues
- Federal, state, and local borrowing is significant

Most bonds are traded over-the-counter:
- Not traded on listed exchange
- Bonds offer less price transparency compared to stocks
    - Bond prices are not easily observable

### Treasury bond pricing
Treasury bond prices are quoted as percentage of faceValue
- Example: a quote is 103.22 and faceValue is $1,000, the bond price is $1,032.20
- Treasury bonds pay semiannual coupons

- Bid price: price paid for a security
- Ask price: selling price for a security
- Big-ask spread: difference between bid and ask; represents dealer’s profit on a round-trip trade

### Inflation vs. Interest Rates
- Nominal rates are rates that have not been adjusted for inflation
- Real rates have been

Example, an investment is bought at $100 and sold a year later for $115.50. Inflation over the year was 5% what was the nominal rate of return? What was the real rate of return?

Nominal rate of return = $${endingValue \over{initialValue}} - 1$$

Nominal rate of return = $${115.50 \over{100}} - 1 = .155$$ (15.5%)

Fisher effect:

$${(1 + nominalRateOfReturn) = (1 + realRateOfReturn) \times{(1 + inflationRate)}}$$

$${(1 + .115) = (1 + realRateOfReturn) \times{(1 + .05)}}$$

realRateOfReturn = .10 (10%)

The Fisher effect describes the relationship between nominal return, real returns, and inflation.

### Term structure of interest rates
Term structure is the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates.
- Represents the pure time value of money
- Nominal rates on default fee securities
- Upward sloping term structure: long-term rates > short-term rates
- Downward sloping term structure: long-term rates < short-term rates

Components of term structure:
- Real rate of interest
- Inflation premium; compensation for expected future inflation
- Interest rate risk premium; compensation for bearing interest rate risk; increases with maturity

### Determinants of bond yields
Bond yields reflect several effects:
- Real rate of interest
- Premiums reflect compensation for:
    - Expected future inflation
    - Interest rate risk
    - Default risk
    - Taxability
    - Liquidity

## Chapter 8: Stock valuation

A stock is an equity instrument; a stock issuer is issuing shares of ownership, who purchase for an expected rate of return—stock owners have a claim on the future residual cash flows of the issuer.

Valuing a stock is more difficult relative to a bond as:
1. Cash flows are uncertain
2. Stocks have infinite life (no maturity—no end date of final cashflow)
3. No easily observable required rate of return

**Fundamental theory of evaluation**: the market value of a financial asset equals the presentValue (PV) of its future cash flows.

Cash flows to a common stock share holder:
1. Dividends
2. Future sale price

Example: You want to purchase a stock, the firm will pay $2 dividend in one year and you believe you can sell the stock in one year for $88. If you require a 10% rate of return, what price should you pay today?

- presentValue = $${futureValue \over{ (1+rate)^{year}}}$$
- presentValue = $${ ($2 + $88) \over{ (1+.10)^{1}}}$$ = $81.82

If the market price of the stock today is $85, would you buy the stock? Based on our evaluation, the stock is overpriced and we will not earn the 10% required rate of return.

If we were to sell it in 2 years and receive 2 cash dividends:

- presentValue = $${cashDividend \over{ (1+rate)^{year}}} + {cashDividend \over{ (1+rate)^{year}}} + {priceInSellPeriod \over{ (1+rate)^{year}} }$$
- presentValue = $${$2 \over{ (1+.10)^{1}}} + {$2 \over{ (1+.10)^{2}}} + {$88 \over{ (1+.10)^{2}} }$$

---

Side note: Many stocks do not pay dividends. A stock that _currently_ pays no dividends can be valued due to the expectation of future dividends.

---

### Stock valuation: 3 special cases
To assign value to a stock we make assumptions to simplify future dividends:
1. Zero growth; dividends do not change
2. Constant growth; dividends grow at constant rate
3. Non-constant growth; short-term fast growth then subsides to constant growth

### Zero growth
- presentValue = $${dividend \over{rateOfReturn}}$$

Example: A corporation common stock pays a $1 constant dividend with a required rateOfReturn of 10%. What is the price of the stock today? What is the price of the stock in one year?

- presentValue = $${dividend \over{rateOfReturn}}$$
- presentValue = $${1 \over{.10}}$$ = $10

As all dividends have the same value the price of a zero-growth stock will never change given a constant discount rate and expected cash flow.

### Constant growth
Dividend growth model only works if growthRate is less than requiredRateOfReturn.

- $$dividend_{periods} = {dividend_0 \times{(1+growthRate)}^{periods}}$$
- $$period_0 = {dividend_0 \times{(1+growthRate)}^{periods} \over{requiredRateOfReturn - growthRate} }$$
- $$period_t = {dividend_0 \times{(1+growthRate)}^{t+1} \over{requiredRateOfReturn - growthRate} }$$

Example: A common stock paid a $2 dividend. If the dividends grow at a constant rate of 7% and the required rate of return is 10% what is the price of the stock today? What is the price in 4 years? Why can’t growth rate exceed the required return?

Today:

- $$period_0 = {dividend_0 \times{(1+growthRate)}^{periods} \over{requiredRateOfReturn - growthRate} }$$
- $$period_0 = {$2 \times{(1+.07)}^{1} \over{.10 - .07} }  = $71.33$$

In 4 years:
- $$period_t = {dividend_0 \times{(1+growthRate)}^{t+1} \over{requiredRateOfReturn - growthRate} }$$
- $$period_{4} = {$2 \times{(1+.10)}^{4+1} \over{.10 - .07} } = $93.50$$

If growth rate is larger than required rate of return the stock price becomes infinite.

### Non-constant growth
If growthRate exceeds requiredRateOfReturn then we can discount high growth dividends separately, discount the constant growth dividends and sum.

Example: A common stock pays a $0.50 dividend in one year, a $1 dividend in 2 years, and a $1.50 dividend in 3 years. After year 3, dividends will grow at a constant 5% rate. Assume a required return of 10%. What is the price of the stock today?

Step 1: Calculate presentValue of constant growth period (3-infinity):
- $$period_0 = {dividend_0 \times{(1+growthRate)}^{periods} \over{requiredRateOfReturn - growthRate} }$$
- $$period_{3} = {$1.50 \times{(1+.10)}^{1} \over{.10 - .05}} = $31.50$$

Step 2: Calculate presentValue of non-constant growth period (t = 1, 2, 3):
- $$period_{t} = {dividend_t \times{(1+growthRate)}^{t} \over{(1 + requiredRateOfReturn)^{t}}}$$
- $$period_{0} = {$0.50 \times{(1+.10)}^{1} \over{(1 + .10)^{1}}} + {$1 \times{(1+.10)}^{2} \over{(1 + .10)^{2}}} + {$1.50 \times{(1+.10)}^{3} \over{(1 + .10)^{3}}} + {$31.50 \over{(1 + .10)^{3}}} = $26.07$$

### Required rate of return
$$totalReturn = {dividedYield + capitalGainsYield}$$

dividedYield: (expected cash divided by currentPrice)

capitalGainsYield: rate of investment value growth

- $$price_0 = {dividend_0 \times{(1+growthRate)}^{periods} \over{requiredRateOfReturn - growthRate}}$$

Rearrange dividend growth model for requiredRateOfReturn:
- $$requiredRateOfReturn = {dividend_0 \times{(1+growthRate)}^{periods} \over{price_0}} + growthRate$$

Example: A stock has paid a $5 per share dividend and is projected to grow at 5% per year. What is the required return if the stock sells today for $65.63?

- $$requiredRateOfReturn = {$5 \times{(1+.05)}^{1} \over{$65.63}} + .05 = .13$$ (13%)

### Common Stock features
- Common stock is equity without priority for dividends—or in bankruptcy.
- Common stock shareholder rights:
    - Elect directors—elected at annual stockholders meeting—one share, one vote
    - Cumulative voting: all directors elected at once—easier to get minority shareholder representation
    - Straight voting: directors elected once at a time—freezes out minority shareholders
- Stagger voting makes takeover less likely to succeed as it’s hard to replace a majority of directors
- Proxy voting grants authority to vote shares on their behalf—common for large corporations.
    - Shareholders can vote by attending annual meeting or vote by proxy
    - Proxy fights attempt to replace management by electing enough directors

Other rights of common stock ownership:
- Dividends shared proportionally
- Liquidation value shared proportionally
- Voting in important matters (e.g., mergers)

Dividends are a return on shareholder capital paid in the form of cash or stock:
- Not a tax deductible business expense for firm
- Individuals pay tax on dividends (15-20% on qualified dividends
- Subject to double-taxation—taxed when paid to shareholders

### Preferred Stock features
Preferred stock represents equity in the first but has many features of debt:
- Stated yield (stated dividend)
- Preference for cash flows in liquidation
- Credit ratings (like bonds)
- Convertible preferred; can be converted to common stock

Features:
- Preferred stock has priority over common stock
- Often no voting rights
- Directors may choose not to pay preferred dividends

### Stock markets
- Primary market: original sale of new securities
- Secondary market: trading of previously issued securities

- Dealer: maintains inventory, ready to buy/sell at any time
- Broker: arranges for transactions between investors
- Bid price: dealer buying price
- Ask price: dealer selling price
- Bid-ask spread: dealers compensation for the risk of holding inventory

#### Stock market trading venues
- Organized exchange: trading done face-to-face
- Over-the-counter market: trading done through dealers over digital networks
- Electronic communication networks (ECNs): networks that allow investors to trade directly with each other.

## Chapter 12: Capital market history

### Required return
How do you determine an appropriate requiredRateOfReturn? Based on the associated investment risk—greater the risk, greater the required return.

Example: If you’re considering two different stocks: stockA is a well-established company, stockB is a new tech company that just went public.

The start-up has more uncertainty and thus a greater requiredRateOfReturn.

### Dollar returns
Dollar return has two components:
- Income (dividend payment, coupon payment)
- Capital gain, or loss (price appreciation, or depreciation)

Example: If you purchased 100 shares of a stock at the start of the year at $37 per share and sell all 100 shares at the end of the year for $40.33 per share and the firm paid a dividend of $1.85 per share during the year what is your total dollar return? Is this a good return? What if another investment offered a total dollar return of $700—is this better?

- $$totalDollarReturn = {(shares \times{dividendPerShare}) + (shares \times{sharePurchasePrice - shareSellPrice})}$$
- $$totalDollarReturn = {(100 \times{$1.85}) + (100 \times{($40.33 - $37)})} = $518$$

totalDollarReturn needs to be weighted by the _size_ of the investment.

- $$rateOfReturn = {totalDollarReturn \over{totalDollarInvestment}}$$

The same return with a lower totalDollarInvestment has a better rateOfReturn.

### Percentage returns
How much do we get in return for each dollar invested?

- $$percentageReturn = {endingDollarAmount - initialDollarInvestment \over{initialDollarInvestment}}$$
- $$percentageReturn = {dividendYield + capitalGainsYield}$$
- $$percentageReturn = {dividendPaid_{t+1} \over{stockPrice_{start}}} + {stockPrice_{end} - stockPrice_{start} \over{stockPrice_{start}}}$$

Example: If you purchased 100 shares of a stock at the start of the year at $37 per share and sell all 100 shares at the end of the year for $40.33 per share and the firm paid a dividend of $1.85 per share during the year.

- Step 1: Calculate the dividendYield
- Step 2: Calculate the capitalGainsYield
- Step 3: Calculate the totalPercentageReturn

Step 1: Calculate the dividendYield
- $$dividendYield = {dividendPaid_{t+1} \over{stockPrice_{start}}}$$
- $$dividendYield = {$1.85 \over{$37}} = 0.05$$ (5%)

Step 2: Calculate the capitalGainsYield
- $$ capitalGainsYield = {stockPrice_{end} - stockPrice_{start} \over{stockPrice_{start}}}$$
- $$ capitalGainsYield = {$40.33 - $37 \over{$37}} = 0.09$$ (9%)

Step 3: Calculate the totalPercentageReturn
- $$percentageReturn = {dividendYield + capitalGainsYield}$$
- $$percentageReturn = {0.05 + 0.09} = 0.14$$ (14%)


Example: Calculate the percentage return for the following investments if you invested $1,000 in each:
- StockA: initialPrice of $50.25, endingPrice of $54.88, dividend of $0.50 per share.
- StockB: initialPrice of $17.35, endingPrice of $16.05, dividend of $0.15 per share.

- $$percentageReturn = {dividendPaid_{t+1} \over{stockPrice_{start}}} + {stockPrice_{end} - stockPrice_{start} \over{stockPrice_{start}}}$$
- $$totalDollarReturn = initialInvestment + (initialInvestment \times{percentageReturn})$$
