#### Multiple Cash Flows

Variables:
- L1: investments
- L2: accrued years
- R: rate (potentially L3, if it changes between years)

Equations:
- FV = PV * (1+rate)^year
    - `sum( seq( L1(I) * (1+R) ^ (I-1), I, 1, dim(L1) ) )`
- PV = FV / (1+rate)^year
    - `sum( seq( L1(I) / (1+R) ^ (I-1), I, 1, dim(L1) ) )`

#### Annuities
Variables:
- Present Value Annuity (PV Annuity)
- Dollars in Period
- Rate
- Periods

Equations:
- presentValueAnnuity = dollarsInPeriod * ((1- (1 / ((1+ rate) ^ periods))) / rate)
- dollarsInPeriod = presentValueAnnuity / ((1- (1 / ((1+ rate) ^ periods))) / rate)


## Chapter 1: Introduction to Corporate Finance
Finance is making decisions to maximize value to owners.

Value is driven by cash flows, not income.



## Key equations
### Chapter 2: Financial statements, taxes and cash flow


- $$assets = {liabilities + shareholdersEquity}$$
- $$income = revenues - expenses$$
- $$cashFlowFromAssets = cashFlowToCreditors + cashFlowToStockholders$$
    - $$cashFlowFromAssets = operatingCashFlow (OCF) - netCapitalSpending - changeInNetWorkingCapital (NWC)$$
    - $$operatingCashFlow = EBIT + depreciation - taxes$$
    - $$netCapitalSpending = endingNetFixedAssets - beginningNetFixedAssets + depreciation$$
    - $$changeInNetWorkingCapital = endingNWC - beginningNWC$$
- $$cashFlowToCreditors = interestPaid - netNewBorrowing$$
- $$cashFlowToStockholders = dividendsPaid - netNewEquityRaised$$
- The ratio of net working capital to total assets:
    - $$netWorkingCapitalToTotalAssets = {netWorkingCapital \over{totalAssets}}$$
- The interval measure:
    - $$intervalMeasure = {currentAssets \over{averageDailyOperatingCosts}}$$
- The total debt ratio:
    - $$totalDebtRatio = {totalAssets - totalEquity \over{totalAssets}}$$
- The debt-equity ratio:
    - $$debtEquityRatio = {totalDebt \over{totalEquity}}$$
- The equity multiplier:
    - $$equityMultiplier = {totalAssets \over{equityMultiplier}}$$
- The long-term debt ratio:
    - $$longTermDebtRatio = {longTermDebt \over{longTermDebt + totalEquity}}$$
- The times interest earned (TIE) ratio:
    - $$timesInterestEarnedRatio = {EBIT \over{interest}}$$
- The cash coverage ratio:
    - $$cashCoverageRatio = {EBIT + deprecation \over{interest}}$$

## Chapter 7: Interest rates and bond valuation

### Bond valuation formula
- rate (r) = Coupon Rate (annual or semiannual)
- time (t) = periods to maturity
- C = dollarCouponPayment (annual or semiannual)

$$price = {couponPV + faceValuePV}$$

$$price = {\left( C \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^t}}} \over{r}}\right)}  + {faceValue \over{(1+r)^t}}$$


### Bond valuation
- Equity ≈ ownership
- Bond ≈ loan, with legal claim to future cashflows

### Bond features
- **Bond**: loan, debt
- **Coupons**: promised interest payments
- **Face Value**: promised repayment amount (par value, maturity value)
- **Coupon Rate**: $${annualDollarCoupon \over{faceValue}}$$
- **Maturity**: years until face value is paid

### Bond values and yields
- Cashflows of a bond: coupons and faceValue
    - To find market price: discount cashflows at market discount rate
- Cashflows of a bond are fixed
    - Market interest rates change ▶ discount rate changes ▶ price of bond changes (PV)
- Two cashflow components to a bond
    - Annuity (level coupons)
    - Lump sum (faceValue)
- YieldToMaturity (YTM): required market rate on a bond
    - Bond “discount rate,” or “yield”

### Bond example

A corporation issues a bond with 10 years to maturity. The bond has an annual coupon of $80, and a face value of $1,000. Similar bonds in the market have a YTM of 8%. What is the price of the bond? What is the coupon rate?

Steps:
1. Draw cashflow timeline
2. Calculate present value (PV) of coupon payments (using annuity formula)
3. Calculate present value (PV) of face value payment
4. Calculate the total bond price
5. Calculate the coupon rate

Step 2: Calculate present value (PV) of coupon payments with annuity formula:

$$PVA = {coupon \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^t}}} \over{r}}}$$

$$ $536.81 = {80 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1.08)^10}}} \over{.08}}}$$

Step 3: Calculate present value (PV) of face value payment

$$presentValue = {facevalue \over{(1+r)^t}}$$

$$463.19 = {$1000 \over{(1.08)^10 }}$$

Step 4: Calculate the total bond price

$$price = {$536.81 + $463.19} = $1000$$

Step 5: Calculate the coupon rate

$$couponRate = {annualDollarCoupon \over{faceValue}}$$

$$.08 = {$80 \over{$1000}} = 8\% $$

As couponRate = yieldToMaturity (YTM), this is a “Par Bond,” implying the price of the bond = faceValue—a unique case.

Now, a year passes in our above example and the company now has nine years until maturity and the market interest rate has risen by 10%. What is the new bond price? What is the relationship between couponRate, yieldToMaturity, and price?

- time (t) = 9
- rate (r) = .10

Step 2: Calculate present value (PV) of coupon payments with annuity formula:

$$PVA = {coupon \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^t}}} \over{r}}}$$

$$460.72 = {80 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1.10)^9}}} \over{9}}}$$

Step 3: Calculate present value (PV) of face value payment

$$presentValue = {facevalue \over{(1+r)^t}}$$

$$424.10 = {1000 \over{(1.10)^9}}$$

Step 4: Calculate the total bond price

$$price = {couponPV + faceValuePV}$$

$$price = {$460.72 + $424.10} = $884.85$$

The coupon rate has not changed; however, yieldToMaturity has.

As couponRate (8%) < yieldToMaturity (YTM) (10%), this is a “Discount Bond,” a bond that sells for less than its face value.

What if the market interest rate had fallen to 6% instead of rising to 10%?

$$price = {couponPV + faceValuePV}$$

$$price = {\left( 80 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1.06)^9}}} \over{.06}}\right)}  + {1000 \over{(1.06)^9}}$$

$$1136.04 = {544.14 + 591.90}$$

As couponRate (8%) > yieldToMaturity (YTM) (6%), this is a “Premium bond,” a bond that sells for more than its face value.

### Bond values
- **Par Value Bond**: a bond that sells for its face value
- **Discount Bond**: a bond that sells for less than its face value
- **Premium Bond**: a bond that sells for more than its face value
- **Coupon rate**:  $${annualDollarCoupon \over{faceValue}}$$

#### YTM vs. Price
As yieldToMaturity (YTM) increases, bond price decreases—an inverse relation.

#### Interest Rate vs. Bond Value (Interest rate risk)
- Longer maturity time means greater interest rate risk.
    - As maturity increases the change in interest rate is magnified.
    - Like the effect of lump sum payments as time increases
- Lower the coupon rate means greater interest rate risk.
    - A bond with a lower coupon rate has more of its value built into lump sum payment at maturity.
    - As the coupon rate and present value (PV) of lump sum changes this effect is larger on the bond value for a lower coupon bond.

### Solving for yieldToMaturity (YTM)
Calculate the YTM for a 6 year, 8% coupon bond (annual payments), price = $955.14, faceValue = $1,000.

- couponRate = $${annualDollarCoupon \over{faceValue}}$$
- 8% = $${annualDollarCoupon \over{1000}}$$ , annualDollarCoupon = 80

$$price = {\left( C \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^t}}} \over{r}}\right)}  + {faceValue \over{(1+r)^t}}$$

$$955.14 = {\left( $80 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^6}}} \over{r}}\right)}  + {1000 \over{(1+r)^6}}, r = .09 $$

### Bond values: Semiannual Coupons

- Semiannual bonds make coupon payments twice a year
- Adjustments
    - Halve annual coupon payment
    - Halve quoted yieldToMaturity (YTM)
    - Double period years (t)

For example, what is the price of a bond with an 11% coupon rate that makes semiannual payments for 20 years at a YTM of 13%? How does the price compare to a bond that makes annual coupon payments?


- couponRate = $${annualDollarCoupon \over{faceValue}}$$
- 11% = $${annualDollarCoupon \over{1000}}$$ , annualDollarCoupon = 110

- Semiannual Adjustments
    - Halve annual coupon payment, Semiannual coupon payment = $${110 \over{2}}$$ = $55
    - Halve quoted yieldToMaturity (YTM) (r), $${.13 \over{2}}$$ = $.065
    - Double period years (t), 20 * 2 = 40

$$price = {\left( C \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1+r)^t}}} \over{r}}\right)}  + {faceValue \over{(1+r)^t}}$$

$$price = {\left( $55 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1.065)^{40}}}} \over{.065}}\right)}  + {1000 \over{(1.065)^{40}}} = $858.54 $$

If we had annual payments:

$$price = {\left( $110 \times { {1 -  {1 \over{(1.13)^{20}}}} \over{.13}}\right)}  + {1000 \over{(1.13)^{20}}} = $859.51 $$

---

effectiveAnnualRate (EAR) = $${1 + {yieldToMaturity \over{2}}^{2}}$$

effectiveAnnualRate (EAR) = $${1 + {.13 \over{2}}^{2}}$$ = .1342 (13.42%)

effectiveAnnualRate (EAR) 13.42% > yieldToMaturity (YTM) 13%, anytime we have compounding frequency greater than once a year, the EAR > YTM.

### Bond features
- Characteristics of debt securities
    - Creditors (lenders) generally have no voting rights
    - Payment of interest on debt is a tax deductible business expense
    - Unpaid debt is a liability, subjects the firm to legal action if they default.

As equity is ownership, equity holders are paid after debt holders.

- Short-term debt: under 1 year to maturity
- Long-term debt: more than 1 year to maturity

The legal written agreement between borrower and lender is a _bond indenture_.

- Registered form: ownership is recorded, payment direction to owner of record.
- Bearer form: payment made to holder, the bearer, of bond—no record of owner.

Security, debt classified by collateral:
- Mortgage securities: bonds are backs by mortgage on real property.
- Debenture: unsecured debt with no collateral with greater than 10 years maturity.
- Note: unsecured debt with less than 10 years maturity.

Seniority, order of precedence claims:
    - Senior vs subordinated debt

Repayment, early repayment is typical:
    - Sinking fund, early redemption

Call provision, allows issue to call or repurchase part or all of the issue:
    - Callable in 10 years (10 years of call protection)

Protective covenants, limiting actions of the firm
    - Negative covenant — “shall not…” (e.g., merger)
    - Positive covenant — “shall…” (e.g., maintain collateral)

Government bonds:
- Issued by U.S. Treasury
- No default risk
- Treasury bills are bonds less than one year to maturity, “risk free rate”
- Treasury notes are bonds with 2-10 year maturities
- Treasury bonds are bonds with up to 30 year maturities
- Interest exempt from state taxes

Corporate bonds:
- Issued by corporations
- Have default risk, or credit risk
- Callable and convertible
- Secure and unsecured (“debentures”)

Municipal bonds — “Munis”:
- Issued by state and local governments
    - School districts, hospitals, universities
- Varying degrees of default risk
- Interest income (coupons) are exempt from federal taxes, and often state and local taxes
- Attractive to investors in high tax brackets
- Because of tax exemption, yields are lower than comparable taxable bonds
    - Need to make a conversion to compare _taxEquivalentYield_ (TEY)
    - $$muniTaxEquivalentYield = {taxFreeYieldToMaturity \over{1 - taxRate}}$$

Example:
- AA corporate bond yield = 6.6%
- AA municipal bond yield = 4.8%
- In a 35% tax bracket, the AA municipal bond is a better investment as the muniTaxEquivalentYield = $${4.8 \over{1 - .35}}$$ = 7.38%
- In a 22% tax bracket, the AA corporate bond is a better investment as the municipal bond muniTaxEquivalentYield = $${4.8 \over{1 - .22}}$$ = 6.15%


Zero coupon bonds:
    - No coupon payments
    - Deep discount bonds are bonds with a price much lower than faceValue
    - Long-term zero coupon bonds have very high interest rate risk
        - Generally, lower coupons and high maturity = more interest rate risk

Example:
- Zero coupon bond with $1,000 faceValue, 12% YTM, and 5 years to maturity. What is the price of this bond?

$$price = {couponPV + faceValuePV}$$

$$price = { 1000 \over{(1+.12)^{5}}} = $567.43$$

A deep discount bond.

### Bond ratings
Bond ratings assess the creditworthiness of the issuer
- Assesses the issuers ability to make principal and interest payments
- Bond ratings, or credit ratings, are only concerned with default risk
    - Not a measure of interest rate risk
    - One could have a highly rated bond with significant interest rate risk

### Bond markets
Bond trading volume is significantly higher than stock trading volume; U.S. Treasury bonds are one of the highest volume security markets.
- Many more bond issues than stock issues
- A company can have multiple bond issues
- Federal, state, and local borrowing is significant

Most bonds are traded over-the-counter:
- Not traded on listed exchange
- Bonds offer less price transparency compared to stocks
    - Bond prices are not easily observable

### Treasury bond pricing
Treasury bond prices are quoted as percentage of faceValue
- Example: a quote is 103.22 and faceValue is $1,000, the bond price is $1,032.20
- Treasury bonds pay semiannual coupons

- Bid price: price paid for a security
- Ask price: selling price for a security
- Big-ask spread: difference between bid and ask; represents dealer’s profit on a round-trip trade

### Inflation vs. Interest Rates
- Nominal rates are rates that have not been adjusted for inflation
- Real rates have been

Example, an investment is bought at $100 and sold a year later for $115.50. Inflation over the year was 5% what was the nominal rate of return? What was the real rate of return?

Nominal rate of return = $${endingValue \over{initialValue}} - 1$$

Nominal rate of return = $${115.50 \over{100}} - 1 = .155$$ (15.5%)

Fisher effect:

$${(1 + nominalRateOfReturn) = (1 + realRateOfReturn) \times{(1 + inflationRate)}}$$

$${(1 + .115) = (1 + realRateOfReturn) \times{(1 + .05)}}$$

realRateOfReturn = .10 (10%)

The Fisher effect describes the relationship between nominal return, real returns, and inflation.

### Term structure of interest rates
Term structure is the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates.
- Represents the pure time value of money
- Nominal rates on default fee securities
- Upward sloping term structure: long-term rates > short-term rates
- Downward sloping term structure: long-term rates < short-term rates

Components of term structure:
- Real rate of interest
- Inflation premium; compensation for expected future inflation
- Interest rate risk premium; compensation for bearing interest rate risk; increases with maturity

### Determinants of bond yields
Bond yields reflect several effects:
- Real rate of interest
- Premiums reflect compensation for:
    - Expected future inflation
    - Interest rate risk
    - Default risk
    - Taxability
    - Liquidity
