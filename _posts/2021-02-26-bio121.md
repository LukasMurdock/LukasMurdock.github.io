**What is included in the term “environment”?** → Our environment consists of all the living and nonliving things around us.

**What is “environmental science”? How might “environmental biology,” our course’s title differ?** → Environmental science is the scientific study of how the natural world works, how our environment affects us, and how we affect our environment. Environmental biology focuses on studying specific organisms.

**Natural resources are divided between renewable and nonrenewable natural resources. How do they differ and what are examples of each?**

- Inexhaustible renewables: Solar energy, wind energy, wave energy, geothermal energy
- Exhaustible renewables: Fresh water, Forest products, Biodiversity, Soils
- Nonrenewables: Crude oil, natural gas, coal, minerals

Perpetually renewable, or inexhaustible, resources such as sunlight and wind energy **(a)** will always be there for us.

Renewable resources such as timber, soils, and fresh water **(b)** are replenished on intermediate time scales, if we are careful not to deplete them.

Nonrenewable resources such as minerals and fossil fuels **(c)** exist in limited amounts that could one day be gone.

**What are “ecosystem services” and what are some examples of them?**

Ecosystem services are our planet’s ecological systems purify air and water, cycle nutrients, regulate climate, pollinate plants, and recycle our waste.

For example, forested hillsides help people living below by purifying water and air, cycling nutrients, regulating water flow, preventing flooding, and reducing erosion, as well as by providing game, wildlife, timber, recreation, and aesthetic beauty.

**Approximately how many humans are found on planet Earth? What factors is associated with the dramatic increase in human population?**

Today our population has grown beyond 7 billion people. 

Industrial revolution

- Fossil fuels
- Cities and factories
- Industrialized agriculture
- Better medicine
- Better sanitation

**What does an ecological footprint represent and what does it mean that we have overshot the Earth’s capacity by current calculations (and by how much)?**

An ecological footprint expresses the cumulative area of biologically productive land and water required to provide the resources a person or population consumes and to dispose of or recycle the waste the person or population produces.

> An ecological footprint shows the total area of biologically productive land and water used by a given person or population.

It measures the total area of Earth’s biologically productive surface that a given person or population “uses” once all direct and indirect impacts are totaled up.

Analyses by one research group indicate that we have overshot Earth’s biocapacity—its capacity to sup- port us—by 50%. We are using renewable natural resources 50% faster than they are being replenished.

**How has environmental condition impacted historical societies?**

Civilizations have crumbled when pressures from population and consumption overwhelm resource availability.

- the fall of the Greek and Roman empires;
- the Angkor civilization of Southeast Asia;
- and the Maya, Anasazi, and other civilizations of the Americas.

In Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere in the Middle East, areas that today are barren desert had earlier been lush enough to support the origin of agriculture and thriving ancient societies. Easter Island has long been held up as a society that self-destructed after depleting its resources, although new research paints a more complex picture.

**How are “ethics” defined as a field of study? What is environmental ethics?**

Ethics is a branch of philosophy that involves the study of good and bad, of right and wrong. The term ethics can also refer to the set of moral principles or values held by a person or a society.

Environmental ethics is the application of ethical standards to relationships between people and nonhuman entities.

**Distinguish between the three ethical perspectives/worldviews: Anthropocentrism, biocentrism, and ecocentrism.**

- **Anthropocentrism** describes a human-centered view of our relations with the environment. Anthropocentrism denies, overlooks, or devalues the notion that nonhuman entities have rights and inherent value. Anthropocentrism evaluates the costs and benefits of actions solely according to their impact on people.
- **Biocentrism** ascribes inherent value to certain living things or to the biotic realm in general. In this perspective, human life and nonhuman life both have ethical standing. A biocentrist might oppose clearing a forest if this would destroy a great number of plants and animals, even if it would increase food production and generate economic growth for people.
- **Ecocentrism** judges actions in terms of their effects on whole ecological systems, which consist of living and nonliving elements and the relationships among them. An ecocentrist values the well-being of entire species, communities, or ecosystems over the welfare of a given individual. Implicit in this view is that preserving systems generally protects their components, whereas protecting components may not safeguard the entire system.

**What are the preservation ethic, conservation ethic, and land ethic, and who is associated with each ethic?** Be able to recognize a statement as belonging/representing these different ethics.

- **Preservation ethic** holds that we should protect the natural environment in a pristine, unaltered state.
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, John Muir.

- **Conservation ethic** holds that people should put natural resources to use but that we have a responsibility to manage them wisely.
Gifford Pinchot

- **Land ethic** holds that people should view themselves and “the land” as members of the same community and that we are obligated to treat the land in an ethical manner.
Aldo Leopold


**What inequities are of concern to the environmental justice movement? Removal of lead from gasoline (p 19) is touted as a success story—do you expect that this resolved an environmental justice issue?**

Environmental justice involves the fair and equitable treatment of all people with respect to environmental policy and practice, regardless of their income, race, or ethnicity.

Yes?

**How does population size, consumption drive, and energy choices influence sustainability?**

Our consumption of resources has risen even faster than our population. The modern rise in affluence has been a positive development for humanity, and our conversion of the planet’s natural capital has made life better for most of us so far. However, like rising population, rising per capita consumption magnifies the demands we make on our environment.

**How does the US’s ecological footprint compare to other nations? (See Figure 1.16)**

Shown are ecological footprints for average citizens of several nations, along with the world’s average per capita footprint of 2.7 hectares. One hectare (ha) = 2.47 acres.

## PrepG_1

**What is the difference between “Descriptive Science” and “Hypothesis-driven Science”?**

- **Descriptive science**: gather basic information not yet well known—explore new frontiers of knowledge by observing and measuring phenomena to gain a better understanding of them.
- **Hypothesis-driven science**: using experiments to test hypotheses within a framework traditionally known as the scientific method.

**What is the difference between a hypothesis and a prediction?**

- **Hypothesis**: is a statement that attempts to explain a phenomenon or answer a scientific question.
- **Prediction**: specific statements that can be directly and unequivocally tested.

**How do you distinguish dependent and independent variables?**

- **Independent variable**: a variable the scientist manipulates
- **Dependent variable:** a variable that depends on the independent input

**What is a control and why are they valuable in an experiment? What is the role of replicates?**

- **Control**: an unmanipulated point of comparison for the manipulated treatment.
- **Replicates**:

**It is correct to say “A study supports the hypothesis...” rather than “The study proves the hypothesis....” Why?**

If experiments fail to disprove a hypothesis, this lends support to the hypothesis but does not prove it is correct.

**What is a strength of a manipulative experiment relative to a “natural” experiment/study? What is a strength of a natural experiment relative to a manipulative study?**

- **Manipulative experiment**: provides strong evidence because it can reveal causal relationships, showing that changes in an independent variable cause changes in a dependent variable
- **Natural experiments:** compare how dependent variables are expressed in naturally different contexts, and to search for **correlation**, or statistical association among variables

**What are four ways that data are commonly displayed in graphs?**

- Line graph
- Bar chart
- Scatter plot
- Pie chart

**Is the independent variable typically on the x- or y-axis in the graphs in Figure 1.9?** → X-axis

**What is the importance of peer review to the scientific process?** → Peer review is a valuable guard against faulty research contaminating the literature from although personal biases and politics can sometimes creep in the review process.

**Why is it worth noting the funding the source? How could funding source influence scientific outcomes?** → A researcher obtains data showing their funding source in an unfavorable light may be reluctant to publish the results for fear of losing funding— or worse yet, could be tempted to doctor the results.

**How is a scientific theory different from a hypothesis?**

- **Theory**: a widely accepted, well-tested explanation of one or more cause-and-effect relationships that have been extensively validated by a great amount of research.
- **Hypothesis**: a simple explanatory statement that may be disproved by a single experiment

A theory consolidates many related hypotheses that have been supported by a large body of data.

**What is a paradigm shift?** → When a dominant view, is abandoned for another.

**What are the reasons that Oreskes believes we should trust scientists?** → Trust based on evidence under scrutiny. “Show me the evidence.”

## PrepG_2

**What “ecosystem service” do oysters provide? Why are oyster populations reduced to 1% of their former abundance in the Chesapeake Bay?**

Hundreds of millions of oysters kept the bay’s water clear by filtering nutrients and phytoplankton (microscopic photosynthetic algae, protists, and cyanobacteria that drift near the surface) from the water column.

Perpetual overharvesting, habitat destruction, virulent oyster diseases, and water pollution had nearly eradicated this economically and ecologically important organism from bay waters.

**How has loss of oysters impacted the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem? How does hypoxia occur?**

with so few oysters in the bay, elevated nutrient levels have caused phytoplankton populations to increase. When phytoplankton die, settle to the bay bottom, and are decomposed by bacteria, oxygen in the water is depleted—a condition called hypoxia—which creates “dead zones” in the bay.

**What is a “systems approach”?**

Assessing questions holistically.

No matter how we attempt to isolate or define a system, we soon see that it has connections to systems larger and smaller than itself. Systems may exchange energy, matter, and information with other systems, and they may contain or be contained within other systems. Thus, where we draw boundaries may depend on the spatial (space) or temporal (time) scale on which we choose to focus.

**What happens in a negative and positive feedback loop? What are examples of each?**

**Negative feedback loop** → output that results from a system moving in one direction acts as input that moves the system in the other direction. Input and output essentially neutralize one another’s effects, stabilizing the system. (body temperature in humans)

**Positive feedback loop** → increased output from a system leads to increased input, leading to further increased output, and so on. Drives the system further toward an extreme. (population growth)

**Dave Schulte designed an experiment to test a restoration approach in the Chesapeake Bay. What was the experiment and what did it show?**

to construct artificial reefs like those that once existed, to get oysters off the bottom—away from smothering sediments and hypoxic waters—and up into the plankton-rich upper waters.

it proposed a combination of native oyster restoration, a temporary moratorium on oyster harvests (accompanied by a compensation program for the oyster industry), and enhanced support for oyster aquaculture in the bay region.

**Eutrophication:** nutrient over-enrichment, increased production of organic matter, and subsequent ecosystem degradation.

**What is the major source for both nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay?**

Runoff from agriculture was a major source of these nutrients, contributing 43% of the nitrogen and 55% of the phosphorus entering the bay.

**How many marine hypoxic dead zones are there around the world? (See Fig. 2.5)**

More than 500

**Ecosystem ecology focuses on the movement of energy and nutrients through an ecosystem. What is an ecosystem?**

An ecosystem consists of all organisms and nonliving entities that occur and interact in a particular area at the same time. Animals, plants, water, soil, nutrients—all these and more help compose ecosystems.

**How does the movement of nutrients differ from energy (which flows through ecosystems requiring a constant input into the system)?**

Nutrients move through ecosystems in nutrient cycles (or biogeochemical cycles) that circulate elements or molecules through the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.

**How is water involved in nearly all other nutrient cycles?**

Water carries nutrients, sediments, and pollutants from the continents to the oceans via surface runoff, streams, and rivers. These materials can then be carried thousands of miles on ocean currents. Water also carries atmospheric pollutants to Earth’s surface when they dissolve in falling rain or snow.

**The oceans are the largest reservoir in the hydrologic cycle, holding more than ____% of all water on Earth. In what form is most of the freshwater?**

The oceans are the largest reservoir in the hydrologic cycle, holding more than 97% of all water on Earth. Less than 1% of the planet’s water is in a form that we can readily use—groundwater, surface fresh water, and rain from atmospheric water vapor.

**What are some ways that human activity affects the water cycle?**

- By damming rivers, we slow the movement of water from the land to the sea, and we increase evaporation by holding water in reservoirs.
- We remove natural vegetation by clear-cutting and developing land, which increases surface runoff, decreases infiltration and transpiration, and promotes evaporation.
- Our withdrawals of surface water and groundwater for agriculture, industry, and domestic uses deplete rivers, lakes, and streams and lower water tables.

**The largest reservoir of carbon is in what and found where? Second largest?**

The largest reservoir of carbon, sedimentary rock, is formed in oceans and freshwater wetlands. Ocean waters are the second-largest reservoir of carbon on Earth.

**How do humans affect the carbon cycle?**

Human activity affects the carbon cycles through our uses of coal, oil, and natural gas.

**Level of carbon in the atmosphere, in the form of carbon dioxide, is the largest atmospheric reservoir in ... how many years?**

Today’s atmospheric carbon dioxide reservoir is the largest that Earth has experienced in the past 1 million years, and likely in the past 20 million years.

**Note that the nitrogen cycle moves through the earth, water, and atmosphere, while the phosphorous cycle does not have an atmospheric component.**

**What are some of the methods to reduce nutrient pollution? Fig. 2.24 notes the differences in cost of different strategies—given that some approaches will have additional costs or benefits, are there some approaches that seem better than others?**

planting forested buffers

**The extinction of species on the Hawaiian island mirrors the biodiversity crisis in areas around the world. What were some of the causes listed for extinction of some of the bird species found nowhere else in the world?**

Polynesian settlers colonized the islands, cutting down trees and introducing non-native animals.

**Natural selection:** inherited characteristics that enhance survival and reproduction are passed on more frequently to future generations than characteristics that do not, thereby altering the genetic makeup of populations through time.

**In what ways is understanding evolution useful for society?**

we depend on a working knowledge of evolution for the food we eat and the clothes we wear, each and every day, as these have been made possible by the selective breeding of crops and livestock. Applying an understanding of evolution to agriculture can also help us avoid antibiotic resistance in feedlots and pesticide resistance in crop-eating insects

**What are some sources of genetic variation upon which natural selection can act?**

Accidental changes in DNA, called **mutations**, give rise to genetic variation among individuals.

Genetic variation also results as organisms mix their genetic material through sexual reproduction.

**What are some examples of evolution by means of natural selection?**

Through artificial selection we’ve chosen animals possessing traits we like and bred them together, while culling out individuals with traits we do not like. Through such selective breeding, we have been able to augment particular traits we prefer.

**How many species have been described? What is the estimated number of species on earth?**

Scientists have described about 1.8 million species, but many more remain undiscovered or unnamed. Estimates vary for the actual number of species in the world, but they range from 3 million up to 100 million.

**How does allopatric speciation occur?**

**Speciation**: the process by which new species are generated is termed.

**Allopatric speciation**: Where species form from populations that become physically separated over some geographic distance. Populations must remain isolated for a very long time, generally thousands of generations

**What does a phylogenic tree demonstrate?**

Phylogenetic trees can show relationships among species, groups of species, populations, or genes. Once a phylogenetic tree is created, traits can be mapped onto the tree according to which organisms possess them, and we can thereby trace how the traits have evolved.

**What does the fossil record reveal about the evolutionary history of life on Earth?**

The fossil record shows that the number of species existing at any one time has generally increased, but that the species alive on Earth today are just a small fraction of all species that have ever existed. During life’s 3.5 billion years on Earth, complex structures have evolved from simple ones, and large sizes from small ones. However, simplicity and small size have also evolved when favored by natural selection; it is easy to argue that Earth still belongs to the bacteria and other microbes, some of them little changed over eons.

**When does extinction usually occur? What conditions lead to extinction?**

Extinction occurs when environmental conditions change rapidly or drastically enough that a species cannot adapt genetically to the change; the slow process of natural selection simply does not have enough time to work.

Small populations are vulnerable to extinction because fluctuations in their size could, by chance, bring the population size to zero.

Endemic species face elevated risks of extinction because when some event influences their region, it may affect all members of the species.

**How many mass extinction vents have occurred and how do they differ from the background extinction rate?**

Fossil record reveals that Earth has seen at least five events of staggering proportions that killed off massive numbers of species at once. These episodes, called mass extinction events, have occurred at widely spaced intervals in our planet’s history and have wiped out 50–95% of Earth’s species each time.

Hypotheses as to what caused the end-Permian extinction event include massive volcanism, an asteroid impact, methane releases and global warming, or some combination of these factors.

**What is the Sixth Extinction and what is the cause?**

Changes to our planet’s natural systems set in motion by human population growth, development, and resource depletion have driven many species to extinction and are threatening countless more. As we alter and destroy natural habitats; overhunt and overharvest populations; pollute air, water, and soil; introduce invasive non-native species; and alter climate, we set in motion processes that combine to threaten Earth’s biodiversity. Because we depend on organisms for life’s necessities—food, fiber, medicine, and vital ecosystem services—biodiversity loss and extinction ultimately threaten our own survival.

**How have the Great Lakes been connected by humans to the eastern Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico? How has this contributed to the threat and spread of invasive exotic species in the Great Lakes?**

When Chicago (inset) built canals and reversed the flow of the Chicago River to flow into the Illinois River, this connected the watersheds of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, enabling species to move between them, affecting aquatic communities in each watershed. Today an electric barrier (see inset) is in place to try to stop Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes.

Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away at their eastern end, the Great Lakes were connected to the Atlantic Ocean when engineers completed the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959. This 600-km (370-mi) system of locks and canals along the Saint Lawrence River allowed ocean-going ships to travel into the lakes. It also allowed access for non-native species, including the sea lamprey, an eel-like creature that began attacking and parasitizing the lakes’ freshwater fish. All told, the Great Lakes today host 180 non-native species that are considered to be invasive.

**Competition is defined as a negative-negative interaction among two species (interspecific competition) or among individuals within the same species (Intraspecific competition). In what way(s) is it negative for both players in the interaction?**

In competitive interactions, each participant exerts a negative effect on other participants by taking resources the others could have used.

**Resource Partitioning is one outcome of competition—how could it contribute to species coexistence? What effect should resource partitioning have on the strength of competition (i.e., should it make it stronger or weaker)?**

For example, if two bird species eat the same type of seeds, natural selection might drive one species to specialize on larger seeds and the other to specialize on smaller seeds.

**There are three types of species interactions that benefit one species, while negatively impacting another species—what are they? (Table 4.1 may help) Distinguish between each.**

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8154a611-473a-4909-990c-5c2b5c9d008b/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8154a611-473a-4909-990c-5c2b5c9d008b/Untitled.png)

**Predator-prey interactions can drive selection for traits for either predator or prey. What are some of the outcomes of selection that can result and how would they enhance/reduce the advantage of individuals with that trait? (Figure 4.4 may help)**

![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6beb1b58-5396-4b31-971c-0b7444744589/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6beb1b58-5396-4b31-971c-0b7444744589/Untitled.png)

**Why would mutualistic interactions evolve? What are some examples?**

Mutualism is a relationship in which two or more species benefit from interacting with one another. Generally, each partner provides some resource or service that the other needs.

**What is a “keystone species” and which species in a community are more likely to be a keystone?**

A species that has strong or wide-reaching impact far out of proportion to its abundance is often called a keystone species.

**What is a trophic cascade? [Definition at the back of the book is clearer than definition in this section—but the text in this section offers some good examples.] What is an example of a trophic cascade?**

A series of changes in the population sizes of organisms at different trophic levels in a food chain, occurring when predators at high trophic levels indirectly promote populations of organisms at low trophic levels by keeping species at intermediate trophic levels in check. Trophic cascades may become apparent when a top predator is eliminated from a system.

**What are three ways communities may respond to disturbance?**

1. A community that resists change and remains stable despite disturbance is said to show resistance to the disturbance.
2. A community may show resilience, meaning that it changes in response to disturbance but later returns to its original state.
3. A community may be modified by disturbance permanently and never return to its original state.

**Distinguish between primary and secondary succession.**

Primary succession follows a disturbance so severe that no vegetation or soil life remains from the community that had occupied the site. In primary succession, a community is built essentially from scratch.

Secondary succession begins when a disturbance dramatically alters an existing community but does not destroy all life and organic matter. In secondary succession, vestiges of the previous community remain, and these building blocks help shape the process.

**While traditional ecology suggested that succession would lead to predictable climax communities, today we understand that succession is less predictable than earlier believed. What can result in a “regime/phase” shift? How are novel communities part of this change?**

A regime shift, or phase shift, in which the character of the community fundamentally changes. This can occur if some crucial climatic threshold is passed, a keystone species is lost, or a non-native species invades.

Today human disturbance and the introduction of non-native species are creating wholly new communities that have not previously occurred on Earth. These novel communities, or no-analog communities, are composed of novel mixtures of plants and animals and have no analog or precedent. Given today’s fast-changing climate, habitat alteration, species extinctions, and species invasions, scientists predict that we will see more and more novel communities.

**Distinguish introduced and invasive species. What factors increase the likelihood of an introduced species become invasive?**

Plants and animals brought to a new area may leave behind the predators, parasites, herbivores, and competitors that had exploited them in their native land. If few organisms in a new environment eat, parasitize, or compete with an introduced species, then it may thrive and spread. As the species proliferates, it may exert diverse influences on other community members.

**What does the ecological recovery of Mount Saint Helens suggest about the system’s resilience? Will it return to the same ecological community? Did humans aid or hinder its recovery?**

The results also show life’s resilience. Even when the vast majority of organisms perish in a natural disaster, a few may survive, and their descendants may eventually build a new community.

Ecological change at Mount Saint Helens will continue for many decades more. All along, ecologists will continue to study and learn from this tremendous natural experiment.

**Why is prevention often viewed as the best policy in invasive species management?**

However, most of these are localized or short-term fixes. With one invasive species after another, managers find that control and eradication are so difficult and expensive that trying to prevent invasions in the first place represents a better investment.

**What are the end goals of restoration ecology?**

Restoration ecologists research the historical conditions of ecological communities as they existed before our industrialized civilization altered them. They then devise ways to restore altered areas to an earlier condition. In some cases, the intent is to restore the functionality of a system—to reestablish a wetland’s ability to filter pollutants and recharge groundwater, for example, or a forest’s ability to cleanse the air, build soil, and provide wildlife habitat. In other cases, the aim is to return a community to its natural “presettlement” condition.

**What is the largest restoration project in the world and what is it attempting to restore?**

The world’s largest restoration project is the ongoing effort to restore the Everglades, a vast ecosystem of marshes and seasonally flooded grasslands stretching across southern Florida.

**What are zoonoses and how common are they?**

Zoonoses are diseases transmissible from humans to animals. Sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases that affect humans are zoonotic — they originate in animals. And more than two-thirds of those originate in wildlife.

**What are some examples of zoonoses? And what role can domesticated animals play?**

AIDS, Ebola, West Nile, SARS, Lyme disease

influenza, the he Nipah virus, 

Research Institute found that more than two million people a year are killed by diseases that spread to humans from wild and domestic animals.

**What factors contribute to the increase in emerging infection diseases in recent decades?**

Any emerging disease in the last 30 or 40 years has come about as a result of encroachment into wild lands and changes in demography.

**What are some examples of how habitat change has increased disease risk—and what are the implications for diseases that have not yet jumped from wildlife to humans?**

So we’re going to the edge of villages, we’re going to places where mines have just opened up, areas where new roads are being built. We are going to talk to people who live within these zones and saying, ‘what you are doing is potentially a risk.’
