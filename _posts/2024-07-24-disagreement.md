> you can expect 3 different kinds of responses when you propose something:
>
> - A disagreement on outcome. There is a fundamental disagreement between you and the other person on the end desire or goal that you want to achieve.
> - A disagreement on mechanism. While your goal may be shared by the other person, there is disagreement on the proposed solution to reach that goal.
> - An agreement and alignment. There is both agreement on outcome as well as the mechanism to achieve that outcome.
