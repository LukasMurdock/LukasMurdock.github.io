Edit 03/07/2021: I started this as a reflection of years as I neared my last of being a teenager. I like this and hopefully will keep it updated as a loose timeline of sorts.

Feels weird.

Looking back now I draw lines by education and it’s only after thinking harder that more meaningful delineations come to mind.

For the past couple years I’ve tried to keep a timeline of events I find meaningful at the time, because looking back those  events are easily lost.

Also, I’m really bad with dates. And school years go between years but we’re just going to ignore that.

## 2000 Born and stuff
Born in Kettering Ohio.

## 2007 First coding experience
Uncle wanted to show me Ruby on Rails or Rails, but I couldn’t wrap my head around it at the time. (Sourced from my Heroku account.)

Also first learned about HTML and CSS and started to build small projects but it took too much time to create so I got bored.

## 2012 First social media
Joined Twitter in December 2012. Seems notable. I’m the type of guy to create a Twitter account in 2012 but not post anything until 2015-2016.

Also created Github account.

## 2013 Created YouTube/Google? Account
Must have gotten my first laptop around this time as well. Google acquired YouTube so I’m not sure about the account structure and I’ll just attribute this to when I first signed up for YouTube.

Some favorite channels of the time:
- FilmRiot
- Corridor Digital
- Sam and Niko (now Corridor Crew)
- Ryan Higa
