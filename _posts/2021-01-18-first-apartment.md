title: 'First Apartment'
description: "Getting my first apartment."
date: January 18, 2021

Going unfurnished to test what I *really* need. When I travel I take a mere [backpack](https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/borealis-nf0a3kv3) with everything I need.

But if I’m living, I’ll want a few more things. My filter for decisions is an attempt for anything that I bring/acquire for my apartment to fit into my small coupe.

Things I plan to take from home:
- Clothes
- Lights
- Blankets
- Monitor
- Beach chair
- Bike
- Hammock
- Towels
- Mug
- Water bottle
- Whiteboard
- Posters

Things to acquire for apartment:
- Bed
- Desk for working
- Chair for working
- Table for eating
- Water filter
- Window coverings (required by lease agreement?)
- Cooking appliances
- Router
- Renters Insurance
- Misc Items

I’d *really* love an [air purifier](https://cowaymega.com/products/coway-mighty-ap-1512hh) and piano but we have bigger priorities listed above.

Here’s a quick rundown of the products I’m looking at:

## Bed
This [post from J-Life International](https://jlifeinternational.com/blogs/news/a-complete-guide-to-the-japanese-sleep-system) sold me.

I have a partner, so size requirements go up to queen—if I’m going to go bigger might as well equip to my 6' 3" size as well.

| **Total** | $**910** | $**1000** |

*Beds, fit for two, are expensive*.

J-Life International [The Japanese Futon](https://jlifeinternational.com/pages/the-japanese-futon):

> The best way to determine your needs is to purchase the Shiki Futon to start. Try it for at least a week. If you feel that you need additional support or comfort, purchase the 3-Fold Mattress.

After watching [J-Life International Full Futon Bed Setup and First Impressions](https://youtu.be/a1p25Zy1EdU), I put more weight on the Kakefuton than Tatami Mats. Now opting for a rug or a mere blanket to separate it from the apartment carpet.

## Desk
Standing desks are nice.

[Fold-in-Half Table 48 x 24"](https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/H-4208FIH/Folding-Tables-and-Chairs/Economy-Fold-in-Half-Table-48-x-24)

Could try out a [riser stand](https://www.staples.com/monoprice-universal-monitor-riser-stand-116250/product_24299669).

### Desk Chair

Curious about this [kneeling chair](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073ZN7B52) and [ErgoStool](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-stool). For alternating positions of kneel/stand and chairs that take up minimal space.


## Table for eating

[Coffee table](https://www.amazon.com/GDF-Studio-299909-Caspar-Walnut/dp/B01N9T4K6I/ref=psdc_3733631_t3_B07DK6X5S6?th=1)



## Water filter
Per: [Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/)

- [11 Cup](https://www.amazon.com/PUR-Classic-Filtration-Indicator-Replacement/dp/B00IK5A68I/ref=pd_bxgy_2/139-3783027-5993254)

- [Replacement filter pack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WVDVDXB/)

## Cooking appliances
Taking inspiration from [Minimal Wellness Kitchen](http://minimalwellness.com/kitchen/) and their list of [kitchen essentials](http://minimalwellness.com/minimalistkitchenessentials/).

Here’s the thing, I’m not going to buy anything until I realize I want to use it.

So my current essentials are:
- Electric kettle
- Pan
- Pot
- Can opener
- Cutting board
- Forks, spoons, knifes, bowls, plates, cups (Max four)
- Wooden cooking utensils
- Cumin, ginger, paprika, tumeric, chili pepper, pepper and salt.

Things yet-to-be essential but I see coming:
- Colander
- Knife 8"
- Rice cooker?
- Slow cooker
- Blender
- [Juicer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DCKYJ5D?tag=juicerb-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1)

## Router
Hopefully can just pick one off from someone I know.

## Misc Items

- Laundry basket
- [Quip custom bundle](https://www.getquip.com/store/products/electric-toothbrush-starter-set) seems cooler than refilling everything
