## Jargon, explained simply
- Crypto: previously colloquially referred to cryptography, now colloquially refers to _cryptocurrency_
- Cryptocurrency: like digital tokens in a game, but on the blockchain.
- Blockchain: a database intended to be distributed among many private parties
- NFT: Like baseball cards traded digitally using the blockchain

## My perspective
In general, I have more qualms than obligations with the cryptocurrency space—and it holds no real importance to me. The web is already [open by default](https://youtu.be/7rW9vTrN6OU)—and it’s about what you help others do.

However, I think this [narrative has propagated](https://lukasmurdock.com/idea-virus/) enough to where it won’t die off anytime soon.
