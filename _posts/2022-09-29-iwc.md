title: 'Ideas Worth Caching'

The [TED](https://www.ted.com/) slogan of “Ideas worth spreading” has stuck with me.

I believe a parallel form exists in [cached thoughts](https://lukasmurdock.com/cache/): _Ideas worth caching_.

Ideas worth making quickly available to yourself, not something that’s particularly sharable.

## Etymology

I use the following two sites multiple times a day now:

- [Websters 1913](https://www.websters1913.com/words/Etymology)
- [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/)

I fully realized words themselves had derivable meaning from [you’re reading the wrong dictionary](https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary) by James Somers and [Aspire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6713378-aspire) by Kevin Hall.

## Resonance


## Levels of abstraction

I first learned of the idea of abstraction from [Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) by Bret Victor.

### Be specific

Often, people don't want to trust you when you state the abstract generalization. And often aren’t content with deducing support for this generalization from the further generalization. They want enough details enough that they can model-check
