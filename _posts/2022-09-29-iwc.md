title: 'Ideas Worth Caching'

The [TED](https://www.ted.com/) slogan of “Ideas worth spreading” has stuck with me.

I believe a parallel form exists in [cached thoughts](https://lukasmurdock.com/cache/): _Ideas worth caching_.

Ideas worth making quickly available to yourself, not something that’s particularly sharable.

## Etymology

I use the following two sites multiple times a day now:

- [Websters 1913](https://www.websters1913.com/words/Etymology)
- [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/)

I fully realized words themselves had derivable meaning from [you’re reading the wrong dictionary](https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary) by James Somers and [Aspire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6713378-aspire) by Kevin Hall.

## Levels of abstraction

I first learned of the idea of abstraction from [Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) by Bret Victor.

### Be specific

Often, people don't want to trust you when you state the abstract generalization. And often aren’t content with deducing support for this generalization from the further generalization. They want enough details enough that they can model-check

## Disagreement


> If disagreement persists the true sources of disagreement are either hard to communicate, or hard to expose. E.g.:
> * Uncommon, but well-supported, scientific knowledge or math;
> * Long [inferential distances](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/inferential-distance);
> * Hard-to-verbalize intuitions, perhaps stemming from specific visualizations;
> * Zeitgeists inherited from a profession (that may have good reason for it);
> * Patterns perceptually recognized from experience;
> * Sheer habits of thought;
> * Emotional commitments to believing in a particular outcome;
> * Fear that a past mistake could be disproved;
> * Deep self-deception for the sake of pride or other personal benefits;
