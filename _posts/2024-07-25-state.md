Firstly, [No silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet).

1. State functions
2. Type system

## State functions

### FSM: State and transition explosion

> A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two types—deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines. For any non-deterministic finite-state machine, an equivalent deterministic one can be constructed.

The complexity of a traditional FSM tends to grow much faster than the complexity of the system it describes.

### Hierarchically nested states

Statecharts, UML state diagrams, hierarchical state machines (HSMs)

### Local vs global vs server
