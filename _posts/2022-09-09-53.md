## Charge

Messaging and positioning

Challenges:
- [Winning new customers](https://www.themarketingstudent.com/how-brands-grow/)
    - Increase the probability someone will notice, recognize, and/or think of Fifth Third Bank in buying situations
    - This isn’t about storytelling; it’s about friction and placing things into someones mind that they’ll remember
- [Cultivate Branding _power_](https://lukasmurdock.com/power/#power-five-branding) with “younger generations” (Affective valence & uncertainty reduction)
    - [Narrative propagation](https://lukasmurdock.com/idea-virus/)
    - What story will we tell? Why will they tell their friends?

## Priors

I know very little about banks or banking.

My primary bank accounts are with online banks because 1) they advertised heavily with people I trust, 2) have good ratings on NerdWallet, 3) high APY, and 4) I never want to walk into a bank branch.

I also do not have any loans.

The only resource I know who talks about banks is Patrick McKenzie (patio11).

I was not aware _regional_ banks were a thing, although I guess it makes sense. It feels strange that I would not be able to open an account at a bank because of the state I live in.

I have no concept, nor importance of [banks and community involvement](https://www.google.com/search?q=bank+community+involvement). Is community involvement more significant in banking than other industries?

I grew up in an internet age, and in my room. I have little knowledge of _[geographic regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States#Census_Bureau-designated_regions_and_divisions)_ aside from time zones.

> The dominant understanding in the financial industry is that customers choose their main bank due to convenience, with convenience being defined as “close to home, close to work, or (ideally) on the commute corridor between the two.”

## Self-questions
- What drives people to make new bank accounts?
- What stories do people tell themselves and others about banks?
- What drives people to think/talk about banks?
- What needs are not met by market leaders?
- What status/affiliation/convenience concept instantiations does the industry use?

### What drives people to make new bank accounts?

When we buy or sign up for something, we either reinforce our perceived role and identity or move to a new status role.

I buy Gillette razors. My dad uses Gillette razors. We both received a Gillette on our 18th birthdays. I think to this day it is the most personalized thing I’ve ever been sent by a company. I think Geico did something similar, but it was a card and not a functional item.

American Student List merged with Alloy Direct Marketing to become [ASL Marketing](https://aslmarketing.com/).

My first bank account was a joint-account with my parents, the bank they also used growing up.

People interface with banks because:
- They need a secure place to put their paycheck
    - Prevents _physical_ theft
    - Interest rates help prevent value lost from inflation
- They need to send money (dwindling reason)
- They need a loan
- They need a financial advisor

The goal of brand design isn’t familiarity, comfort, and removal of friction—where it could be any brand. Instead, the goal of brand design is to do the unexpected and create a memorable friction. The goal of brand design is to _create tension_.

Tension drivers:
- Fear of missing out
- Fear of sounding dumb
- Fear of paying too much
- Fear of falling behind
- Fear of social interaction
- Shaming
- Fear of fear
- Actual danger
- Not knowing how it ends
- Discomfort at using something inferior
- Frustration at using a tool that's not the state of the art
- Ennui

### What stories do people tell themselves and others about banks?

Survey.

### What drives people to think/talk about banks?

Survey. When was the last time you talked about a bank? When was the last time you _raved_ about a bank?

### What status/affiliation/convenience concept instantiations does the industry use?
