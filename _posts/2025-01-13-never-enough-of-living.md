Never, my heart, is there enough of living,  \
Since only in thee is loveliness so sweet pain;  \
Only for thee the willows will be giving  \
Their quiet fringes to the dreaming river;  \
Only for thee so the light grasses ever  \
Are hollowed by the print of windy feet,  \
And breathe hill weather on the misty plain;  \
And were no rapture of them in thy beat,  \
For every hour of sky  \
Stillborn in gladness would the waters wear  \
Colors of air translucently,  \
And the stars sleep there.  \

Gently, my heart, nor let one moment ever  \
Be spilled from the brief fullness of thine urn.  \
Plunge in its exultation star and star,  \
Sea and plumed sea in turn.  \
O still, my heart, nor spill this moment ever.  \
