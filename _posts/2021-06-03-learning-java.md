CSE 148 Course Materials: WP V5 STUDENT PACKAGE FOR BIG JAVA LATE OBJECTS (Must be purchased new! Scum.)

Presumably the CSE 148 textbook is the first edition of [Big Java Late Objects](https://www.wiley.com/en-ad/Big+Java%3A+Late+Objects%2C+1st+Edition-p-9781118087886).

Thankfully, this can be found within [Libgen](https://whereislibgen.vercel.app/).

It the “student package” is actually required, that is asinine.
