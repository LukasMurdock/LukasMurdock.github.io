## Referencing

One of the more interesting ways to use GitHub Issues is to reference issues directly from commits. Include the issue number inside of the commit message.

By prefacing your commits with “Fixes”, “Fixed”, “Fix”, “Closes”, “Closed”, or “Close” when the commit is merged into main, it will also automatically close the issue.

References make it possible to deeply connect the work being done with the bug being tracked, and are a great way to add visibility into the history of your project.
