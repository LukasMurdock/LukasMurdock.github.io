I’ve long had a weird compulsion to learn about the various tools used by an industry or area of work and internalize the landscape they make up.

When I got into video editing years ago the simple thing would have been to stick with the first tool I came across and get to work. Instead, off the top of my head, I can still recall important feature sets, differences, and pain points between

- iMovie (Apple)
- Final Cut Pro (Apple)
- Adobe Premiere
- Adobe After Effects
- HitFilm
- Avid

And in design

- GIMP
- Inkscape
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop/InDesign
- Affinity Designer/Photo/Publisher
- Canva

And in marketing

- Moz
- Ahrefs
- SEMRush
- Screaming Frog
- SiteBulb
- Nightwatch

And in development… well [that’s a bigger rabbit hole](https://webref.lukasmurdock.com/sitemap).

I had a plumbing issue recently and learned all about manual augers, drum augers, flat tape augers, power augers… even after I knew I was only going to buy a drum auger I wanted to know the landscape.

“Conway’s Law” is a reference that you can understand systems by understanding the shape of the organization behind them.

I think I am drawn to exploring the tool space because it seems clear to me that you can understand work by understanding the tools used to create it.

_Tools which create work are constrained to produce outputs that are copies of the structure, logic, and limitations of the tools themselves._

It seems knowledge about tools are a [bus ticket](https://paulgraham.com/genius.html) of mine — I collect them and keep distinctions just for the love of it.
