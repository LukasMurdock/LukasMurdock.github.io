Life is full of people prescribing ways they believe you should live. Both online and in-person, if you don't fit perceptions of normal you'll be told to shape up. If you want to be successful, you'll hear all about how you have to be outgoing, boisterous and extraverted. That to be anything valuable in life you must push your way to it. Quiet, nonassertive and introverted? You're not going to make it anywhere. This is the way our culture has been shaped. Schools, educators, and workplaces preach extroverted ideals into spaces where quiet people are shamed for their natural tendencies. Where people who throw themselves into this game and talk often and forcefully are considered a player—someone who advances in the game. And those who don't are viewed as those who won't advance because they are not a player.  

We've made it seem that you have to work hard at being outgoing, or else you're going to be left behind. Imagine instead if we preferred to contribute only when we believe we have something insightful to add, or actually disagree with someone. Or how about the way we view day-to-day activities? In school, taking time to be alone is sad and going out to party is something "everyone does so why don't you."

It's time to consider how we see those different than us—and it turns out everyone is different from us. It's time to slow down, ["test our assumptions, and reconstruct our ideas before we end up bound by what other people tell us—trapped in the way things have always been done."](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/)
