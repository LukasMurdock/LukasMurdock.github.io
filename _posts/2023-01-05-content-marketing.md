Publishing checklist:
- Include keyword in title
- Choose an evergreen URL. [Cool URIs don’t change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI)

Updating posts:
- Make it longer (more context, more tips)
- Make it richer (more data, more research, more user-cases)
- Make it stickier (more examples, imagery, gifs, videos)

Finding ideas with Ahrefs:
1. List competing sites
2. Search them within Ahrefs
3. Tap top pages
4. Find the top pages with a <10 RD (Competing articles with <10 RD are low-hanging fruits to update and reach out to those linking to original piece.)
