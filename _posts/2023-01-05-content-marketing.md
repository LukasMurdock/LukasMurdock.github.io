Example outcome goals:
- Improve website traffic volume which we could potentially measure by tracking the number of unique visitors to the site.
- Improve website conversion rate which we could potentially measure by tracking the number of sales made through the website.
- Improve email subscriber click-through rate which we could potentially measure by tracking the number of clicks on links within the newsletter.
- Improve email subscriber forward rate which we could potentially measure by tracking the number of subscribers who forward the newsletter to others.
- Improve email subscriber conversion rate which we could potentially measure by tracking the number of subscribers who take a specific action, such as signing up for a webinar or making a purchase, after receiving the newsletter.
- Improve social media engagement from our social media followers which we could potentially measure by tracking the number of likes, comments, and shares on our social media posts.


Publishing checklist:
- Include keyword in title
- Choose an evergreen URL. [Cool URIs don’t change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI)

Updating posts:
- Make it longer (more context, more tips)
- Make it richer (more data, more research, more user-cases)
- Make it stickier (more examples, imagery, gifs, videos)

Finding ideas with Ahrefs:
1. List competing sites
2. Search them within Ahrefs
3. Tap top pages
4. Find the top pages with a <10 RD (Competing articles with <10 RD are low-hanging fruits to update and reach out to those linking to original piece.)
