I often say “process over outcomes.”

“[Individuals and interactions over processes and tools](https://agilemanifesto.org/),  “[People over process](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)” are also common phrases that I agree with but they mean something different.

Outcomes are part of the feedback loop to [change process](https://lukasmurdock.com/spc/).

When I say “process over outcome,” I mean “Process drives outcomes. If you want to change the outcome, focus on changing the process.”
