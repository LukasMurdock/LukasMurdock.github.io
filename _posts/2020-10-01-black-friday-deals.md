A few reasons the people you’re looking for didn’t choose you before:
1. They didn’t know you exist.
2. They didn’t see sufficient benefit to act.
3. They didn’t want to pay your price for the resources.

## They didn’t know you exist

Some people didn’t choose you because they didn’t know you exist. By getting the word out you reach more people. And, hopefully, now they know you exist, they will choose you. But for the people who already know you, there’s even more reasons why they didn’t choose you.

## They didn’t see sufficient benefit to act

Some people didn’t choose you because they didn’t have good enough reasons to act then and there. There was no urgency or compelling reason motivating them to act. But now that they’ve taken another look at your offering, they see sufficient benefit. By giving them another chance to review your offer, some people may now feel sufficient benefit to act.

## They didn’t want to pay your price for the resources

Some people didn’t choose you because they didn’t have the desire to pay the price you set for what you were offering. They don’t value your product at your prices. Or possibly, they don’t have the same story with money that you do. By lowering your prices, more people might join if they value your product at that price. But be careful of losing the people who value your product above the price you set, because those people are your real customers.

Every great brand is known for something other than their prices. Even the brands with low prices.

People don’t really want the cheapest. They want something they can be proud of, something a bit better, and they decide the terms for better. But cheaper? Cheaper isn’t better. Cheaper is for those who don’t have the hutzpah to have a product that’s worth something.

Are you creating more value for your customers or are you doing the same work but for less effort and money?

## Black Friday Deals Are Short Term

Acknowledge that most of the people you’ll be reaching with  deals aren’t going to be with you for the long term. Black Friday was built for short-term boosts, accepting cheaper isn’t a long-term investment. It’s a race to the bottom that few can survive.
