We are going for it and we will set aggressive goals.

We are all on the adventure together.

We build products we believe in.

We are here to make a positive difference in society, as well as make a profit.

Each person is important; each has the opportunity and the obligation to make a difference.

We are all in it together, win or lose.

We are creative; we set the pace.

We want everyone to enjoy the adventure we are on together.

We care about what we do.

We want to create an environment in which our values flourish.

We believe in making great products.

We believe in the simple, not the complex.

We believe we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products we make.

We participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution.

We believe in saying no to thousands of projects so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us.

We believe in deep collaboration and cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way that others cannot.

We don’t settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company, and we have the self-honesty to admit when we're wrong and the courage to change.

**All doers, no talkers**: We ship. We publish and put things out into the world. Shipping is fraught with fear. Everyone is afraid. Why bother indulging your fear? The point is to ship.

**Interruption is assault**: Interruption is a sword that cuts into the guts of an unfinished idea. Interruption is arrogance masquerading as efficiency; it is efficiency massacred.

**Trust by default**: When we can’t trust each other, nothing works. Mistrust costs each of us time, money, and a little bit of our humanity.

**Underpromise, overdeliver**: We make promises we can keep. We use humble and truthful language to optimize for our long-term reputation.

**Self Responsibility**: Each of us is responsible for managing. It’s on you to turn off notifications when you’re away from work, organize your knowledge, and design your schedule.

**Show up**: The more we show up and are willing to have faith in others, the more we’ll get back in return.

**Write it up, don’t chat it down**: Writing solidifies, chat dissolves. Substantial decisions start and end with an exchange of complete thoughts, not one-line-at-a-time jousts.

**Build bridges when you cross**: This chasm that has been as naught to me to that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be; He, too, must cross in the twilight dim; Good friend, I am building this bridge for him! ([The Bridge Builder](https://lukasmurdock.com/bridge-builder/))

**Genshai**: Never treat another person in a manner that would make them feel small – including yourself.

**Eliminate, Automate, Delegate**: Hunt for tasks that can be eliminated. If they can’t be eliminated, can we automate them? If not, how can we delegate them?

**Ship fast, learn fast**: A.K.A [Yeet. Delete. Repeat](https://www.jason.af/yeet-delete-repeat).

**Ship work that matters**: We make products we are proud to sell and would recommend to the people we seek to serve. [We can’t ship junk](https://youtu.be/Yu0qeb_rJYU).

**Give it five minutes**: we want you to disagree, we want you to push back, we want you to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give ideas some time to set in before you’re sure you want to argue against them.

**We need you**: We need you to show up. We need you to connect. We need you to lead.
