- PHONETICS: Describes sounds
- PHONOLOGY: Describes the combination of sounds to form syllables/sound clusters.
- MORPHOLOGY: Describes the combination of syllables/sound clusters to form words.
- SYNTAX: Describes the combination of words to form clauses, phrases, or sentences.
- SEMANTICS: Describes the combination of clauses, phrases, or sentences with their meanings.

## Phonology

A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound in a language that can distinguish one word from another. For example, in English, the sounds /p/ and /b/ are phonemes because they can create different words, such as "pat" and "bat". A change in a phoneme can change the meaning of the word.

An allophone, on the other hand, is a variant of a phoneme that does not change the meaning of a word. Allophones are the different ways that a phoneme can be pronounced in different contexts. For example, in English, the "p" sound is pronounced differently in the words "spit" and "pit". Although these sounds are slightly different, they are still perceived as the same phoneme /p/ because they do not change the meaning of the word.

The distinction between phonemes and allophones is important for understanding the sound system of a language. The phonemes of a language are its basic building blocks, while allophones are the various ways that those building blocks can be realized in different contexts.

Two sounds are considered to be allophones of the same phoneme if they occur in the same phonetic context and do not cause a change in meaning.

On the other hand, two sounds are considered to be different phonemes if they occur in different phonetic contexts and can cause a change in meaning.

## Morphology

A morpheme is the smallest unit that has meaning. A morpheme cannot be divived into smaller meaningful parts.

KIND is the _root_ of UNKINDLYNESS.

A root is the basic unit of a word, without a prefix or a suffix.

UNKINDLY is the _stem_ of UNKINDLYNESS.

Aa stem is the main part of a word to which affixes (prefixes, suffixes, infixes) can be added to create new words. It is the core lexical unit of a word, and it carries the word’s primary meaning or semantic content.


### Free vs bound morphemes


### Inflectional vs. derivational

| Inflectional                                   | Derivational                               |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Great + er → Greater                           | Play + er → Player                         |
| (Stem + inflectional)                          | (Stem + derivational)                      |
| bends stem meaning                             | adds meaning to stem                       |
| not likely to change the stem’s part of speech | likely to change the stem’s part of speech |

Inflectional affixes are the last morphemes to attach to stems.

Only nine inflectional suffixes:
- -s
- -es
- ’s
- -ed
- -ing
- -en
- -er
- -est


**Detecting plural markers**

Determine repeating non-solo morpheme.

Prefix: “result” = [PREFIX] + stem

Suffix: “result” = stem + [SUFFIX]

Infix: “result” = stem + [INFIX] + stem

Circumflex: “result” = [PREFIX] + stem + [SUFFIX]

### Affixes

English inflectional affixes are all suffixes.

| Part of speech | Suffix                        | Example      |
|:---------------|:------------------------------|:-------------|
| Noun           | -s 'plural'                   | dog(s)       |
| Noun           | -es 'plural'                  | mango(es)    |
| Noun           | -’s 'possessive'              | Peter’s      |
| Verb           | -ed 'past tense'              | miss(ed)     |
| Verb           | -s '3rd person present tense' | help(s)      |
| Verb           | -ing 'present participle'     | present(ing) |
| Verb           | -en 'past participle'         | eat(en)      |
| Adjective      | -er 'comparative'             | bigg(er)     |
| Adjective      | -est 'superlative'            | dumb(est)    |
