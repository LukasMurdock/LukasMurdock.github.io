## Windows 7/Microsoft Office

I grew up with Windows 7 with Microsoft Office (and Internet Explorer). I remember discovering the animations tab in PowerPoint and making stick figure animations. Microsoft Office was always there, and I learned how to use it from a very young age.

Note: [You Suck at Excel with Joel Spolsky](https://youtu.be/0nbkaYsR94c) is the best resource to learn more about Excel in an hour. (See [notes from Max Masnick](https://maxmasnick.com/2015/09/15/excel/))

## (2014) TI-BASIC Programming

Starting in the 7th grade, we were told to bring a TI-84 to class. I discovered you can write programs on the TI-84 and began writing utility programs to assist in math classes. Computers were made to compute. Wrote a few games as well.

## (2020) Equation auto-solve app
