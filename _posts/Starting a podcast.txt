- Commenting on articles
- Discounts on courses and other products

No soundbites, nothing out of context.

Like waitwho.is but for getting close to people.

Friends as guests and having lengthy conversations (literally for hours)

I’m likely to bring up a controversial topic and you’re free to steer the conversation away from it however you would like.

When I ask why, I am not saying I disagree. I’m simply trying to think less wrong by deepening my understanding.

Bring in:
- People I follow and look up too
- Have open calls for whoever wants to join (anonymously as well)

Free, open:
- Podcasts, video, transcriptions, articles, commenting

Paid, private community (free for students):
- Slack community


## Guides to starting a podcast

https://www.npr.org/2018/11/15/662070097/starting-your-podcast-a-guide-for-students

## Topic 

To leisurely talk about interesting resources and ideas.

A podcast / video / article series on asking people whose content I’ve enjoyed:
- Where do you show up in the world? If I were to go somewhere to learn more about you without talking to you, where would I go?
- On a day-to-day or week-to-week basis, where do you go to inform yourself? What are the specific names of people or organizations that when you come across you pay attention to what they’re saying?
- What has your attention lately?
- Tools they use and their confidence in using them in the long run
