## Introduction

Social psychology is the scientific study of how the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.

Textbook: Social Psychology by Gilovish, Keitner, Chen, Nisbett


## Themes and Methods

### [Norman Triplett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Triplett)

_[Dynamogenic Factors in Pacemaking Competition](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1412188#metadata_info_tab_contents)_: found people behaved differently when observed. Behavior was more than reflex, stimulus, and response. Bike riders:
- against time: slow
- with pacer: faster
- competition against pacer: fastest

### [Kurt Lewin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Lewin)

Founded “social psychology” and argued human behavior is explained by complex dynamic forces acting on an individual—like physical forces shaping the movement of objects.

Competing needs cause tension, and the satisfaction of the need reduces the tension.

### Interpretation & subconscious

Perceptions are subject to interpretation. People are lazy.

_Construal_ is the interpretations or inferences about the people, places, and events we confront.

_Social cognition_ is shortcuts for processing information and making decisions.

_Priming_ is environment cues that guide our interpretation.

_Implicit attitudes_ predict behavior above and beyond explicit attitudes.

### Scientific process

- Research question: What brings people together in romantic relationships?
- Theory: An explanation for how and why variables are related to each other.
- Hypothesis: A specific prediction that derives from the theory.
- Research: A process of making observations to test hypotheses.

Variables:
- variable: Any event, situation, behavior, or individual characteristic that can have more than one possible value.
- construct: Abstract ideas that form the basis of a research hypothesis.
- Operational variables: the definition of an abstract concept used by a researcher to measure or manipulate the concept in a research study.

### Operational variables

There are many operational variables for the same concept. For example, stress:
- Stress self-report rating on some scale
- Heartbeats per minute
- Facial tension, frowning/grimacing, fidgeting
- Number of daily events experienced


### Self-report

- Checklist of objective events
- Likert-type scales

Strengths:
- easy to collect
- get perceptions, judgements, motivations, memories,
- variation along a scale

Weaknesses:
- people know what you’re measuring
- participant burden
- inaccurate

### Behavioral design

Strengths:
- direct behavior
- potentially unobtrusive

Weaknesses:
- complicated to collect
- cannot get motivation behind behaviors
- behaviors may be one-time
- need clear definitions of behavior

### Correlational designs
Look at links between two or more variables as they naturally exist in the world.

Example:
- Correlation between self-esteem and talking in class
- Correlation between average income in a county and number of charitable organizations in a county
Links between gender and importance of physical attractiveness

### Correlation does not equal causation

Did x _cause_ y to happen?

### Experimental method

Internal validity: experimental/situational control (random assignment)

External validity: extent to which the results of the study can be generalized to other people and places.

Strengths:
- test causality
- control

Limitations:
- complicated
- internal and external validity tradeoffs
