Wai means water — a symbol of life. Prosperity or wealth, is waiwai — water-water.

This page is a list of some of the places I visited during my time in Hawai‘i. There are so many more places I didn’t get to visit, or still don’t know about.


[See a Google Maps list of these places](https://maps.app.goo.gl/thhbSeYMoA7HkqEs6).

## Oahu, Waikiki

### Hostels

[Honu Waikiki](https://www.honuwaikiki.com/) is a hostel operated by ALOH Hospitality. Within Waikiki, Honu is part of three other hostels: [Seaside](https://www.seasidehawaiianhostel.com/) and [Beach](https://thebeachwaikikihostel.com/).

As of writing, Honu is the most newly renovated building — as it was renovated two years ago. ALOH also operates a [Aloh Health Bar & Cafe](https://alohcafe.square.site/).

### Food

#### 7-Eleven

If you’re from the states, recommending a 7-Eleven for food may seem strange. [7-Eleven Hawai‘i](https://7elevenhawaii.com/) is locally operated under the direction of 7-Eleven Japan. Try the food, even the spam musubi. It’s great.

#### Sunny’s Local Grind

Located right around the corner from Honu, [Sunny’s](https://www.sunnyslocalgrind.com/) has great food and mid coffee.

#### Goofy Cafe & Dine

The best breakfast I had during my stay was at [Goofy Cafe & Dine](https://www.goofy-honolulu.com/). The wait times tended to be thirty minutes to an hour but it was so worth it.

There is also a cute shop below.

#### Komedokoro M’s

Thankfully, I was recommended [Komedokoro M’s](http://www.eatonsquareshoppingcenter.com/mobile/komedokoroms.html) place for Poke early on in my trip. It’s tucked away in the white arch of Eaton Square.

#### Food truck park

There is a food truck park across the street from Waikiki Brewing Co. Munch 'N Brunch and Earth Aloha Eats were amazing.

#### TY’s BBQ and Grill

Located right in front of Suzy Wong’s Hideaway, [TY’s BBQ and Grill](https://qr.imenupro.com/1b75-8) is a great bite.

#### Waikiki Brewing Co

Located around the corner from Honu, [Waikiki Brewing Co](https://www.waikikibrewing.com/) has great food and beer.

#### Cheeseburger in Paradise

[Cheeseburger in Paradise](https://www.cheeseburgernation.com/) is a sister company to Waikiki Brewing Co.

#### Buho Cocina y Cantina

> Established in 2014, Buho Cocina y Cantina is Waikiki's premier nightlife destination and is set on the vibrant roof top level of Waikiki Shopping Plaza. Buho Cocina y Cantina's beautiful rooftop ambiance pairs perfectly with an incredible view of Waikiki to create an unforgettable fiesta fueled by tacos and tequila.

The dance floor goes crazy.

### Coffee shops

#### Bean about town

[Bean about town](https://www.beanabouttown.com/) had the best coffee I tried during my visit. Located closer to Seaside.

#### Ali’i Coffee Co

Located in the Courtyard Marriott Hotel, [Ali’i Coffee Co](https://www.aliicoffee.com/pages/waikiki) had good food and coffee.

#### Honolulu Coffee at Sheraton Waikiki

Right off of Waikiki beach, [Honolulu Coffee at Sheraton Waikiki](https://www.honolulucoffee.com/pages/sheraton-waikiki) has good food and coffee.

#### Hiking Hawaii Cafe

Located inside the DoubleTree Alana Waikiki by Hilton, [Hiking Hawaii Cafe](https://hikinghicafe.com/).

### Bars

#### Suzie Wong’s Hideaway

Dive bar located right next to Honu.

#### Irish Rose Saloon

Located around the corner from Honu. Live music.

#### Kelley O’Neil’s

Live music.

#### Maui Brewing Co

I had the best drafts at [Maui Brewing Co](https://mauibrewingco.com/).

#### Waikiki Brewing Co

#### Wang Chung’s Karaoke Bar

A LGBTQIA+ Karaoke Bar, [Wang Chung’s](https://www.wangchungs.com/) was a blast with a group.

## Maui, Wailuku

I originally planned to be in Oahu for a week and Maui for a week. I didn’t want to leave the group of friends I kept making, I only had ~30 hours in Maui. Worth it.

### Food

#### 808 Old Town

### Coffee

#### Maui Coffee Attic

A lovely place.

Food and drink is cool and all, but honestly the best part of Hawai‘i was getting to know so many incredible people.
