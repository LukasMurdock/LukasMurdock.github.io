## Process Behavior Charts

### Use

- Find out when a change has occurred in a process
- Evaluate if your process changes made any significant difference to the process
- Determine whether a process is predictable or not
- In predictable processes, predict the range within further measurements will fall if the conditions do not change
- Assess a process performance against a requirement e.g. customer demand and expectations.

### Calculations

- Some value with ideally over 23 data points
- calculate average(X)
- calculate mR
- calculate average(mR)
- calculate UNPL = average(x) + (2.66 * average(mR))
- calculate LNPL = average(x) - (2.66 * average(mR))
- calculate URL = 3.269 * average(mR)

### Terms

- mR – moving range, the difference between two successive values
- UNPL – Upper Natural Process Limit, gives us the best case scenario forecast
- LNPL – Lower Natural Process Limit, gives us the worst case scenario forecast
- URL – Upper Range Limit

### Interpreting

1. **Any point outside the limits** indicates the presence of an exceptional cause that has a dominant effect.
    - If not accounted by cyclical or seasonal patterns
2. **Run of eight** successive values all on the same side of the central line may indicate the presence of an exceptional cause that has a weak but sustained effect.
3. **Runs near the limits** three successive values all within 25% of the upper or lower limits may indicate the presence of an exceptional cause that has a moderate but sustained effect.
4. **Alternating at short intervals** likely means two systems of causes that need to be separated.
5. **Wide limits** are a noise warning that it would be a mistake to react to changes in these values as it is virtually impossible to assign an explanation to why a point goes up or why it goes down.

In a stable process, most of values fall within the 50% area between the limits.
