A (working) list of online courses Iâ€™ve taken (and can remember). This is just a list of courses, not including similar resources Iâ€™ve found valuable, for the sake of brevity. These courses are not the end-all-be-all and there are certainly many more valuable free resources that I wouldnâ€™t consider a _course_.

ðŸ“•: Means Iâ€™m listing the course for my future self to take or further consider
