A (working) list of online courses I’ve taken (and can remember). This is just a list of courses, not including similar resources I’ve found valuable, for the sake of brevity. These courses are not the end-all-be-all and there are certainly many more valuable free resources that I wouldn’t consider a _course_.

📕: Means I’m listing the course for my future self to take or further consider
