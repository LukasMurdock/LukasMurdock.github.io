What is a degree? A degree is a grade or rank to which scholars are admitted by a college or university, in recognition of their attainments.

## What do I want degreeless to be?
1. **A community of students, learners, and doers.**
2. **An online learning resource.**

To help students explore future paths.

To help businesses hire.

To provide the opportunity to **[learn alongside doing](https://sivers.org/contrib)**.


Growing up, I longed to explore future paths. Introverted and shy, exploration needed to be in a low-barrier way. Asking people in-person or online never felt “safe” to me.

Inspired by [Marketing Tools](https://saijogeorge.com/best-marketing-tools/) by Saijo George, I’ve been curating [resources to explore design, development, and marketing](https://lukasmurdock.com/knowledge/).

There are even resources I came across years ago from exploring online.

[Degreeless.design](https://www.degreeless.design/) by Tregg Frank inspired the idea of degreeless.

I believe in a future where the intersection between businesses and students is **a place that provides both direction and connection to learn and get hired**.

The current way things are isn’t perfect, and neither is how I believe they should be. I don’t assume to have all of the answers. I’m just trying to [build my own things that other people can use](https://youtu.be/kYfNvmF0Bqw).

Community first. Creating a tribe.
- **Khan Academy:** For every student, every classroom. Real results.
- **Traffic Think Tank:** Learn, connect, and level up with the best.
- **Akimbo Workshops:** Online communities that help you learn to see.

A way to connect people who want to learn to people who want to teach.

A way to connect people who want to make assertions to people who want a way forward.

## Offerings
1. **Academy** (Self-guided learning)
2. **Mastermind** ([Scenius](https://kk.org/thetechnium/scenius-or-comm/)/communal genius)
3. **Workshops** (Do better work)

**The Academy provides internal and external resources to learn at your own pace.** See [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).

**The Mastermind provides a space to make smart connections.** See [Traffic Think Tank](https://trafficthinktank.com/).

**The Workshop provides a hyper-focused space to guide you through  projects.** See [Akimbo Workshops](https://akimbo.com/).

Ideally a blend of these three can provide space for proper levels of engagement, pricing for longevity, and enough to become the [third-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place).
