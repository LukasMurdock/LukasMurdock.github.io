There are currently two camps. One camp has followed the advice from experts, and you can view it as following orders—that’s not a bad thing. The other camp, doesn’t believe the experts, doesn’t want to follow orders, because this is America and here we seek freedom.

Ill-defined freedom.

I imagine a good portion of Americans are pushing back right now because they don’t want someone telling them new restrictions on what they can and can’t do. And face masks are “something terrorists wear.”
Masks are normalized as something un-American. 

So far, over 130,000 people have died. You can say whatever you want about misattribution to COVID-19, but those deaths take up more than two entire Vietnam War Memorials.

Sanitation and protection is the act of taking care of life.

Nobody wants to have doctors that refuse to wash their hands and wear a mask when undergoing surgery. Face masks protect the patient—you and your loved ones—from wound infection and contamination from the surgeon and other surgical staff members.
Now it’s your turn to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your fellow Americans. Sanitation and protection are the weapons in this war.

> He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: **For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us**.”  
— *The Declaration of Independence,* 1776

The Quartering Act of 1765 required American Colonies to house British soldiers in barracks provided by the colonies. This act was a source of anger between colonies and Great Britain in the years leading up to the American Revolution. Not only because they had to house British soldiers, but they were taxed to pay for the troops’ supplies.

Within the Declaration of Independence, it’s explicitly stated that quartering large bodies of armed troops among the people is an injury and usurpation of the Americans’ rights and liberties.

244 years later, and I believe refusing to quarter large bodies of armed troops among us is still an American value.
When you refuse to wear a mask, you’re willingly allowing your home to be quartered by large bodies of armed troops. Armed troops that have taken so many lives from the United States of America that not even two entire Vietnam War Memorials could hold them.

If you believe this is a foreign virus, made to attack the American People, this next part is even more important. **Don’t quarter it.** This is our fight.

There’s nothing more American than wearing a mask.
