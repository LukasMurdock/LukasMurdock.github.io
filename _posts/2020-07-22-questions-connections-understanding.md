There are many ways to take this.

Questions can [lead people to confirm problematic assumptions](https://effectiviology.com/loaded-question/).

Connections can [make you millions while building things that don’t work](https://themarkup.org/coronavirus/2020/07/16/unemployment-benefits-website-failures-deloitte-ibm).

Helping people feel understood can give you [a cult following](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/).

Or,

Questions can get you to the [relationships underlying a particular problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys).

Connections can [engage people every day to do work that matters for people who care](https://akimbo.com/).

Helping people feel understood can lead us to [new emotions and give us better ways of speaking to each other](https://aeon.co/essays/how-emotionally-focused-couple-therapy-can-help-love-last).

Revolutions come from large teams’ lengthy efforts, but the building starts on the nights and weekends. And it begins with you.

Question, connect, and understand.
