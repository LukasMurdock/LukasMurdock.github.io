Infinite Smiles is a leading dental innovator providing luxury, state-of-the-art dental care led by Dr. Neal Patel.

Dr. Patel brought me in as the first hire on the Design Team at Infinite Smiles. Together, we updated the Infinite Smiles brand and applications, eventually working alongside select dental partners to fill in their design gaps.

With the growth of the team, we embarked on a redesign of all internal and external brand applications of Infinite Smiles. Starting with the creation of a new identity and design system, every customer touch-point was redesigned with it.

At Infinite Smiles, I dove headfirst into WordPress development as I began to explore the map of web development to understand the territory better. The team shifted into The Web Team as we crafted a new digital experience for Infinite Smiles.

My intimate knowledge of filmmaking and cinematography lent itself to lead the development and production of a video series for various marketing touch-points.
