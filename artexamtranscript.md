## [04. Early Literati Arts in China](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/04-early-literati-arts-in-china?module_item_id=2446291)

Okay. Oh, we may as well get started with class today. First of all, any question is about last class, we ended kind of tight on time. There were a lot of questions and there was no chatter in the online discussion boards. I wonder, Are there any issues with the content of last class, with the narrative that was told? Any any questions you wanna ask now? I'm sorry, mass invoice shortcut. It's easiest. Yeah. So I remember that in the previous chapter you bring up the definition for China after the unification and before the founding of the Republic. Republic China has a different definition in Western and Chinese scholars as in a Marxist it because feudalism still like throughout thousands of history is in China. But I would arrange the Western scholars disagree. Would it just be the imperial period of China were something more specific? Right? So let's try and be as clear as possible about this. It's not the whole period of history and before mean Guo before 191112 that we're calling by a different name necessarily. The reason I have that little footnote in there about feudalism is because off to my students who come from a mainland Chinese background of some sort, disagree with the idea that feudal structure, as I'm talking about it. The Zhou dynasty ends with a unification of China. And so I just want to make that clear that for those who come from a kind of Marxist history background, you've learned that feudalism doesn't end until 1911. And that, again, is a different thing than the feudalism, just as a kind of structure of a central state that has few Tories, right? Like states, then, oh, the central state, some sort of allegiance. And that's the structure of Zhou dynasty. Imperial governors are Zhou Dynasty government. What we're interested in the transition from the Warring States period at the end of the Zhou into the chin. And then the Hahn is a different governmental structure where you have centralized power with the emperor at the capital and then the administration from the capital of all of the various provinces that are not administered separately. And that's the switch from a kind of imperial government or unified government, or to be unified government, imperial government from a feudal structure as we're talking about it. And so that sort of aside is just to clarify how that word is used because they know it's used differently in Texas history. Does that make sense wrong? She Thank you very much. Alright. Alright. Any other questions before we move on to this class? Ok, let's get rolling them. So we're moving into a slightly different period and we're still in China. And I know for those of you who might be more interested in Korea and Japan, that you should've wondering why we're spending this much time on China. But it's really because we don't have a lot of time in this class. And that the kinds of larger issues you want to focus on, many of them begin in China. Next class, we'll get to the connection that Buddhism brings to all of East Asia. And we'll talk about Korea and we'll talk about Japan. But for this class, for staying in China. And we're talking about what happens in the period immediately after the downfall of the Hub. And we're talking specifically about this genre or should a broad spectrum of arts that we call literati arts, which become very important from this point onward in China, then eventually it even in Korea and Japan. And the idea of being a literati to us, singular form of literati Is that you or I'm sorry, I'm getting a little bit of distraction. Hold on a sec. The idea of being a literati test is that you are communicating with your sort of fellow peers through references that are embedded in history and other kinds of cultural norms. It's basically elite. Language and elite culture is another way of, of thinking about it. The culture of the highly educated and wealthy. And what we're talking about here to sort of be the beginning of the roots of that which become very important later in China and which we'll, we'll get to. So just to cover a little bit of the kinds of transitions that happen here from this unified empire of the Han. We talked about with this kind of centralized government system that's inherited from the chin. But with the infusion that sensibility that talks about moral obligations between ruler and ruled, between household members and one another, between the living and your ancestors, et cetera. You know, we get a kind of China in many ways as, as we know it as grounded in Confucianism. The Han dynasty ends in basically the late second early third century. It begins to disintegrate at the end of the second century AD or CE in the Common Era. And warlords are basically ruling over these various sections of later Han Dynasty China. Even though an Emperor, Han Dynasty Emperor still rules by name. And the end of the Han is officially announced in 2020 when the last emperor concedes the throne to one of these warlords and enthalpy who founds a new dynasty, a new name. And at this point, Chinese history gets very messy and we're not going to go into all of the different periods which you can see in this chart. That for the next 350 years there was a bunch of shifting sovereignty over various parts of China and there are various names for calling this period. We're calling it by a name that sort of covers the whole period of the end of the Han through the reunification that happens in the late sixth century. And we're calling it The Six Dynasties Period. But it's also known as the Three Kingdoms, which then morphs into the gym Dynasty and the Sixteen Kingdoms and the northern and southern period. Suffice it to say you don't need to know all of these names. You need, we're going to be calling the Six Dynasties Period. And you should know that it's a period of disunity. Again, where there's lots of different separate kingdoms ruling over the territory that had once been unified under the same culture, laws, language, that was China. And there are lots of different sort of micro cultures happening in these various kingdoms were not going to get too deep into the weeds, but we're going to talk about sort of the effects of that on the people that had been once part of a unified Han. And that's where one of our central questions comes in, right? How did the arts in general change in this period and the Six Dynasties Period? Because many of the things that we've been looking at so far, with the exception of perhaps the very earliest things. And maybe the very last thing we looked at the carvings at the family shrine. Have been the result of elite, dynastic even or imperial production. And one of the things that happens in this period of disunity is that many wealthy families, the heads of many wealthy families, retreat from involvement in government. Whereas in the Han, Yu was sort of lauded or how to put it in a different synonym. Celebrated that you should be part of the system of government. And many of the aristocratic families wanted to place their nails into government to sustain power and to sustain networks that maintained power. Many of the sort of highly educated elites of the Han during this period of disunity were fed up with government and the last two generations of the Han Dynasty had just been constant warfare. And so where possible, many of these families retreated to their estates and became hermits and away. Not poor, ragged hermits that are living off of land. Even though that's sort of an idea was, was part of the ideal mindset. These were wealthy folks interested in cultivating them their own self-hood in, in the arts of calligraphy, painting, poetry, et cetera. And certain religions come into this that deviate from this sort of Confucian governmental moral mindset and are much more about the self, such as Taoism, which we don't have a lot of time to get into but comes into play with our piece of calligraphy a bit. And Buddhism, which we'll get to a little bit more. Next class, Buddhism arrived in China. It's mentioned at the very late period of the Han, but it doesn't really thrive until the Six Dynasties Period. And so within all these micro states, we get lots of different visual arts there that are flourishing. Especially a centered around this idea of cultivation. The idea that any idea that you can demonstrate how cultivated, how educated you are through arts like calligraphy and painting and poetry. So that brings us just, that's our kind of generalized background to our first object, which is a hand scroll. We'll get into the structure of hands roles in a minute. A painting. That's our first painting that we're looking at, looking at. And it's a painting after a poem. And the painting in the poem happen at two different periods of time. So let's deal with the poem first, and that's what I had you read for class today. A poem is by a man named voucher. And Salinger wrote this poem, the nib of the law river. And One of the sort of most famous early poems of this period. Soldier was famous. He was a prince in the way of the way dynasty. His brother was the emperor at tau p, The one who convinces the last Han Dynasty Emperor to abdicate the throne. Their father was the famous Han Dynasty general named tau tau. For those of you who come from a more Americanized background. This is, although it's a, it's a 20th century invention and this is where we get the name anyway of general Saul's chicken. So take that to the bank next time you meet American Chinese food out, drop that piece of knowledge on the table. And the poem itself. And sound cheer as a kind of person within this hierarchy of one of these new smaller or kingdoms, the way dynasty. And being the brother to the emperor in that Dynasty. Soldier with someone who couldn't be involved in politics because of the fact that his brother was, in some ways, he couldn't be seen as trying to usurp that power. And we lived mostly off of the fact that his family was one that was that was in, there was in power and he had a lot of time to write poetry and sort of news upon his position as a highly educated elite with time and money to waste, he was known as a bit of a drunk, as a bit of a waste stroll. And some of his poems take us into that territory. But this particular poem, which you've read for class today is taken both as a love poem, sort of supernatural love poem, and also as perhaps an allegory That is a thinly veiled kind of set of references in a fictional world to real life interactions between Saussure and his brother, the emperor. It's considered a kind of allegory of loyalty or devotion to his brother. These are some interpretations of what we're interested in is less the politics at this point, and more the idea of the kind of expressivity of the poem and how it's narrated in the painting. So a hand scroll format is, starts from the right and move to the left. So you've been given this J paragraph that is huge, that can be enlarged. This is long kind of strip. You would never see all of that at once. Instead, what she would do is open it up from the rights and roll it in about a shoulders width of space at any given time. And you'd only see one section at a time. And that meant that basically the body kind of determine the dimensions of each of the scenes that ruled out. And it creates a narrative, right? It's like cinema in a sense. It's a moving film of separate cells, of scenes. And the cells are determined more or less by how much it's appropriate to open the hand scroll about a little over shoulders, width or breadth of upper body. You would view one section at a time, but the landscape, as you'll notice in this hand scroll, is continuous. Even though the characters. Repeat themselves as different moments in time happened. So if you were to unroll the whole hands rot, which are not supposed to do. That's not how you view these. You get lots of different moments of time with the characters repeating and then the landscape tying it all together as a kind of glue to the progression of, of the hand scroll. And so that's how this format of painting works. And so you'll notice that it's very much in relationship to the human body. It's derived from a sort of documents for structured in terms of longer documents having to be in these long hand scrolls. They're very portable and they're not like many of the paintings that we think of, things that are kind of hung on the wall. Instead, they're viewed with the kind of action they have to be engaged with. So we're going to engage with our hands scroll and think about especially how narrative is working. Because again, our story here is an early third century poem by its outer. And poem has a narrative arc to it. All right, of this man chasing this spirit of the river through the night and the kind of love story and a kind of pursuit. But the hidden scroll, unlike what we've looked at before with our single scene narrative, right? Where you just get one moment that stilled in time. And it's a moment of highest tension in the story, right? So you have all this action of these bodies moving through space and these iconographic features that help you to say, well, I know that that is the story of Jin Qu are narrative in the hand scroll, which is continuous, right? That's linked together by the landscape, works slightly differently. So what we're going to try and do is try and think about where in the hand scroll the poem matches and where it doesn't match, and where you can do things in a poem that you can't necessarily do or that you have to do differently, visually, enhance role. So we're going to walk through in the next 20 minutes or so, sort of seen by C in our poem, along with a hand scroll. And this will engage your sense of visual analysis, as well as the idea of thinking about the relationship between a canonical text like this poem and the images painted that illustrate it. Now there's an important footnote here, and it's embedded in your label for this. If you look down at the bottom, you'll see that this painter who Kaiser, who's a very, very famous early painter, doesn't live at the same time as Souter. Saudi dies in the middle of the third century. Geiger does, isn't not born until the middle of the fourth century. These two never would have known each other. But who is painting also in the Six Dynasties Period. And he's illustrating this poem from a 100 years before, much like our Jin Qu image illustrates our, our story from the Records of the Grand Historian from a 100 years before that. So we can think about this image as the illustration of the poem in a later generation. But there's another caveat to this. There wasn't an original fifth century painting called The name of the law. River. Lu Xun full too, which was very, very famous. It, the original doesn't survive. Instead, when we think about the original painting, which is what we're trying to do here, and its original composition. We're using these later copies to do that. This is still a very early later copy. It's an 11th century copy. It's over a thousand years old at this point in time. But it's not the original painting. But we know it preserves the structure of the original and many of the ideas. And that's how we're engaging with it. And that's important to keep in mind the sort of embeddedness of sort of shifted or adjusted chronology here. So I'm going to stop blogging for a minute. And what we're gonna do again is to try and walk through this one scene at a time. So using the chat window when you can and using your and your, your poem that I've given you, try and figure out how we know this is the very beginning of the hand scroll again, moving right to left. What scene? This is a relationship to the poem. What are the details that help us identify where in the poem this is? And when you're ready, just throw it into the chat window, will try and move through it one section at a time. Great. You guys, I'll nail that right. This is the very beginning of the, of the poem, right? And one of the ways in which you are identifying that is those lines. So I stopped, I halted degrees my horse at the spike Nard marshes as Darwin put it, as DnaA wrote, and as Eric wrote, you get, you get these horses stopping to rest. And then it's time to put the horses are on the ground, very much rested and we're not standing up. They don't want to go anywhere. They're laying down to chill the hell out because it's been a long journey, right? So right at the beginning of this poem on page 117, thank you for the page reference there. Whoever put that in, you get, you know, leaving the capital to return to my fiefdom in the East. The E barrier at my back up over Hongyan, passing through that don't Valley crossing matching. The sonnet already dropped. And my character's unsteady though, because the horses were fatigued. So halted my rank this rig in the spike, no hard marshes and graze my team of four at the leech on or like and I'm not sure which one that as fields idling awhile by willow Wood and letting my eyes wander over the law, does that very initial setting and it matches almost exactly to the poem, right? There's a prefacing bit here though, before the actual text of the poem begins, it's important to note that there's a date and strong date on this right, the third year of the Hong true Era of the way dynasty. At chowder is writing prose at this point, I attended court at the capital and then I cross the lower river on my way home. In olden times, he said, man used to say that the Goddess of the river was named full Fei. Inspired by the example of some you who describe the gods to the King of true. This is a very old Joe dynasty text. I compose this f2 poem, which is an old-style poem. Reads this. So you're getting a preface in which it's Alger is giving you the kind of reality situation, right? I was just on a journey that I was inspired to write this ode poem. And then the ODE takes us fixed on this fictional journey. But you're right where the actual narrative matches more or less with his own story. He's traveling from the Capitol and he stops to rest his horses. And just as you guys identified, you get these horses here laying down for arrest. Here are the attendance to the horse. And this group is Souter and his buddies. And, you know, kind of laying out of the scenery first and what the initial event was that makes him stop. And let me get this transition right. The next action after stopping the rest is letting as eyes wander over the law and then his mood seems to shift. And so we're getting an emphasis here in his poem on internal feelings, right, which relates to our idea of self-cultivation. It's about how you feel in some ways and the shift that happens when you're moving through the landscape and something strange and seems to direct your attention or your mood, your feelings toward something else. And his spirit grows restless. So let's try and do that again with this next scene. So we roll the hand scroll from right to left. And all of a sudden this, which was remember before or has turned into this facing the all of this. So what Sr, we have here? What are the details that lead us to believe that in the poem? The poem again. Great. Again, thanks for that. Page numbers. I think that was Eric has ten. You get a break. And in the old poem right? After this sort of spirit changes, right? My mood seem to change. My spirit grew restless and my thoughts were scattered. This is sort of toward the end of 117. First he looks down and doesn't really see what's there. And then he looks up to see something all of a sudden. And he spies a lovely lady by the slopes of the river bank. And Zack, I think, quoted us for that. Takes a hold of the coach, means arm and asks, can you see her? Who could she be? A woman so beautiful? And the coach, when replies, I've heard of the Goddess of the river law, whose name is foo Fey. What you see, my prince, is it not she? What does she look like? I beg you to tell me. And then you have soldier right? With his hands spread between one maybe honest coach funds aren't asking this question. And as he sees it, the bank of the river and here's the flowing water than into the law river. And he stops to ask, who is this? And the Koshland says, well, there's supposed to be in this spirit named Foo fai. What does she look like? And so read anything, Ethan, you, you quoted, this was question happens. Can you see here? And what that creates in the narrative poem is a, a moment for description, right? So that the reader of the poem has the opportunity now to get a full description of what this goddess looks like. But that also tells us that the only person in this scene, we can see the goddess, this Alger himself. For some reason. She's not manifesting to anybody else but to him. So he's having a kind of vision as sun is setting on the river and as he's resting his horses of this goddess. And then that moves into, just as Claire points out, this incredible description. Of how beautiful she is, right? And that's setup narratively. And it also pairs with what we get visually in many ways. And so some of the things we need to think about again, how visually you accomplish something that already exists textually with its own separate narrative. And what the differences and relationships are between the 21 of the key factors that happens in the Thich Nhat Hanh scroll format allows for right with its continuous landscape that ties together these different moments in time is that you get the main figures repeating. And each time it repeats, there's a different moment, right? Singular moment that is important to emphasize in the poem. In this moment that we're getting is our first description of the titular character at the end of the LA, River. And landscape does a job of framing those moments, right? The landscape itself, which is in some ways also the subject of the poem. And we'll get to that in a minute, is framing through the use of smaller and lower hills through the river itself and through these extra elements, the figure shrimp, that landscape is built to give focus to those figures and to break up these moments sense of narrative. And again, it's important. Remember that this nymphal law, river, She is a manifestation of the landscape itself because river aspect of, of the landscape specifically. And so the landscape is being treated in some ways as a anthropomorphization or it's being anthropomorphize that has made into something human. The nib is the landscape, She is the river, and she's also a human, a Bonnie. And just as let's see, all of your described right. How Jo, Claire and many of the rest of you here, you're getting a real full description. Ii. And you had a good quote pulled there of just how beautiful she had. Her body source lightly like a startled swarm, gracefully like a dragon in flight. And this description goes on for a ways, right? The poet soldier does not hesitate to indulge his descriptive capacities over how beautiful this landscape. Nymph, from 117, almost all the way down to one main team. We just get this continual description of the landscape and of her and her in the metaphors of nature as well, right? She's like a startled swan. I could dragon in flight. And we get those illustrated and so bit clearer here on this copy. And remember I said that we were dealing with an 11th century copy here. There are multiple copies that were made in the 11th century of the original hand scroll. Some of them actually have the text of the poem written alongside. So you are getting here. You know, gracefully like a dragon in, in-flight. Something one raw you'll write. So you're getting this figure here. You're getting a flower here in the next part of the inscription and splendor brighter than the autumn chrysanthemum. You just barely see the outline of the flower in this very old painting in bloom, more flourishing than the pine in spring. And so all of these metaphors of creatures or plants in landscape that are used to describe her beauty. And she's standing here in the image are in this version pasted alongside. But no, our version that we're looking at, we just have to look to the images themselves. Think about how this dragon, how these geese are swans, how these flowers are meant to kind of frame the beauty of the woman herself. Jim, is the moon in filmy clouds, restless as Snow World by the driving wins. And here you get a bunch of whirling clouds around a moonscape here at the top as well. And one of the things that's interesting to note is that of the three early copies that have been dated to the 11th century. There are all of the original five century painting. And we know that they're all looking at the same model because structurally at the hands grows more or less the same. Down to the way in which the sleeves below, down to the way in which the landscape is positioned behind the figure. The style of the sort of tree leaves on landscapes which are all meant to in the 11th century emulate this early style or almost copy it. The way in which your hair is done in these sort of double bump it up dues or whatever we're going to call this. The way her fan has these two wings out of it. All of these different painters and 11th century we're looking at the original. And so between the three of them, we can Kabul and understanding of the structure of the original painting. And the fact that these metaphors, the swans, the dragons, the pi and the wind, our own sort of at play in the landscape. And sometimes we can see them more clearly than others as they're illustrated in different versions of the 11th century scrolls. Great, so now we've had that long description in the poem and then we get this moment of a kind of our first glimpse of her. And she's put parallel to these natural metaphors of landscape. Where is our next moment occurring? Who's got the next kind of spot? Where do you think this seems happening again, we're moving right to left through the landscape you've just seen are over here on the side. And she's introduced for the first time. And then we get this sequence of different landscape moments and events where the figure is repeated several times. So where in the poem. Give me a page. Great. So collaboratively you all gave me lots of great detail the work when things kinda starting us off and then American DNN, js for all bumping, bumping that comment. So, alright, we're getting actually a couple of different details here. So you'll notice at the very top, 119, you get out to the left. She plants are colored penance and to the right spreading the shade of Casio flags. So you get these penance and flags were staked out in, in the landscape. But then there's this whole section in the middle of 19 teens action where there's this handoff that was mentioned, I think by Let's see, who mentioned this earlier. Handoff of the jade and the girdle ornament that's bracketed for a moment. Instead, we skip ahead to the bottom of 19 all the way through to you just as you guys pointed out, into the swarming of all of the other figures as it's described in the very last two lines of 119, a swarm of milling Spirit's calling companions less than ten minutes. And then we get all these other landscape deities. We got these two other river deities, the wondering girl from the banks of the Han River. We get the two queens of the xiang River in the south. And we get all of these other descriptions of these various other gods, These friend because these spirits milling about. And so one of the things we want to take away from this is that the narrative as it happens visually, is being organized chaired by glucose in a way that's convenient. Visually, we're getting these fly staked out. And then instead of going directly to what happens, that is this handing off of the belt girdle, right? Which may be this scene. We get all of the other spirits because visually and narratively it makes more sense for those to happen first, in Cu Chi jurors estimation of how this hand scroll should appear. But again, this bracketing of this moment. Where he's trying to find some sort of a proper go between a kind of matchmaker to communicate with this beautiful spirit that he sees. And she's still floating over the river and they swap garnets and a jade belt Ornament. Then the next thing we get is, is much further down into 120, where you get the God P10 calling the wins and the river Lord, it's calling the waves. Here's the river Lord down here, pulling up the waves, hangers pinging, calling the wins. And then we get the drumming here as well. And simple songs offered by new qua. And so again, the narrative does not have to follow exactly as the image goes. The person making the painting can adjust in order to create a more evocative visual narrative or flow. So as we're moving through the landscape, right? We've been moving back and forth in the narrative of the poem. What's happening in this next moment? Yeah. It's one hundred twenty two and twenty one. So she might be in her chariot. Well, the next scene as you move down, it is definitely a chariot, right? And she's definitely fleeing ham. And so this scene, actually, I'm not very sure myself where this happens to be in the poem. It's definitely a moment of interaction where you get soldier on the land, right? He's grounded. She a badass Goddess. She could fly on a phoenix if she wants to. And she's over the river. And it might just be again, this sort of moment of separation where she decides to kind of Flea and go away. Just as jessica sad when she sort of laments the fact that though they've met and that's a happy thing and she's obviously in the poem anyway, expressing some sort of infection for him, that they have to go separate ways. That's on page 121. And again, this next scene, if that's where we are, 21, The Speckled fish here that are carrying her away. And the Jade bells and six Dragon's deeds all here in row must be actually it's before. It's on the bottom of page 120 versus Page 120. One. And after she's already away on this, these fish IS giant fish in these dragons. That's when she's speaking slowly and discussing about their friendship, their relationship, and complaining that men and God's must follow their separate ways, that it has become from two different backgrounds. We can't possibly be together, sort of Romeo and Juliet moment here. And even the well bore ya, we might have these kinds of crushes. She holds up her gaze and coyotes her weeping and then he can't tell where she's gone. So perhaps go guide jurors just added this one extra moment where they get to see each other before she runs away. Again as we're moving through the hand scroll, it's very unclear in the narrative where this happens, but it creates has extra moment as you're moving through the hand scroll for them to pause, to see each other. And then for the kind of pursuit, whoops, backwards. For the pursuit to happen, right? She jumps in her chariot, her fish chariot, and hits the waves essentially. And he can't fog her anymore. And then he hopes to see her again. She's gone from him and so he rents a boat, you know, much less. Sheik then a dragon driven chariot with Jade bells. I hopped on his boat IN drifts along a river trying to get back to her, right? And so we have this long love poem really of longing or have a really hard crush. So let's called a crush. And then as the thing comes to an end, as we're moving toward the bottom of page 121, night has finally arrived, right? And then we get a candle here to show us that we're at nighttime now even that was pharynx behind the painting haven't changed at all. He's unable to sleep and he sleeps through them. Ok. Soaked and heavy Frost says he doesn't have a very good sleep. He's having kind of fever dreams here. And the next day he orders his grim to ready the carriage he thinks about is returned to the Eastern road. That is to go back home. And he seizes the reins and lifts up his wit, but he hesitates. And he can't break away from this kind of love, this feeling that he had for this momentary glimpse of the nymph of the law River. And so again, some of the things you might want to think about here, how our story worked out. We have a poem, a famous poem here by the time who paints it in the fifth century. And by the time it's repainted because Gu Cai jurors, a famous painter in the 11th century. That's when we're seeing it. Our fifth century hand scroll structure that we think is more or less the same, right? Because the different copies evolves, reinforced the same layout of the events that the painter is making different choices than the original narrative. And the painters using different techniques. That sense of time. We get a, we're getting a whole evening's worth of events here, righty stopping at dusk. And all through the evening, he's chasing her. Until you stop and go to sleep and he wakes up and see her again. And the landscape is continuous through this, right? We get these flowing rivers. We get these hills that create these little moments that fill in between the different scenes, major scenes of the poem. And that continuous narrative is actually broken into separate scenes that are all interwoven together because of the structure of the hand scroll, because it's an animated narrative fashion that has time signature to it, right? You move from right to left as you are done viewing each section. And so the landscape also is framing these individual moments and reordering them for visual effect because this is visual rather than textual, that we're getting this information. And so it's not quite the same as our single scene narrative here. And said we're getting multiple figures, the same figure repeated over and over again through some of the same techniques that we see here, right? The iconography. Everytime the nymph is shown, she has her hair up and those double of ribbons. She has her fan as well. And this allows us to identify her as compared to the other figures. Everytime Souter has shown, he is the biggest, is, he's got, he's the most robust body. He's got the beard, he's got different clothes on and everybody else who will kinda fall to the background. And that helps us to identify as we're moving through the scroll, where we're stopping and seeing each moment of the narrative as it's moving along. So again, some of the things we would connect to our larger question here is that we have this period of disunity where all the separate kingdoms have splintered away now from the Unified Han states. Someone like soldier who's brothers, the emperor of one of these smaller new dynasties. The way is devoting himself to writing poetry, cultivating his own sense of classicism, right? He's referencing all these old fables from the past and writing new poems that are about how he feels, right? And that's a new thing. We were getting these voices of figures who are not necessarily in government telling us about love stories. I love narratives, even though there may be a political allegory going on as some people have argued. And then the painting itself from a later period during this period of disunity from the fifth century, still within the Six Dynasties Period. We're getting a painter who is interested in this poem, which is about feelings and is about conveying the sense of soldiers poems in a visual format. This hand scroll that we're getting now for the first time. And again, the idea that a person's character who they are smoke conveyed through the poems there, right? Through the calligraphy and through their painting is something that begins at around this time. Rong Shi Yi Ge jumped the gun because we're going to move now into exactly what you're talking about Chinese characters. We're gonna move to the next object. Wang teachers preface to the Orchid Pavilion gathering and we're going to ask ourselves, well, what does calligraphy in this sense that we're talking about self-cultivation in the Six Dynasties Period. How does the way someone writes have anything to do with who they are, right? So again, we're dealing with a similar period. The period of disunity in the Six Dynasties Period. And Wang teacher is from one of these noble families who decides to kind of retreat from serving in politics and to cultivate his sense of scholarliness away from courts where it's easier to be a more moral person. And we're going to engage again with the content of this, but also with the way in which it's, it's structured as calligraphy and think about how writing conveys a sense of who the person is. It's worth noting again that this is the original text here is David read. Its very beginning is from 353 AD or CE, depending on the terminology you use. But this is a seventh century copy, very finally done outlining fill in copy. And micro analysis says as lead us to understand that this is not the original, just like the Cu Chi drew painting. The original doesn't exist. But this is still something that is 1400 years old and it's about the earliest piece of handwritten calligraphy on paper that exists. So to back up a minute and think about the development of writing. Just as wrong. She was interested in, you know, our first engagement with writing. But it's a crucial moment in history that we emphasize strength. Where in the Shang dynasty at around 1200 we get oracle bones and bronzes with fully formed writing systems on them. Which leads us to understand that there was probably writing before. But this writing is much more visual. It's much less structured in the same way that even classical Chinese writing is structured. And we've talked about the very specific purposes of the objects on which we find this early writing. We briefly talked about some of the burials in the early periods of where we saw bamboo strips like this one. Where you get ink on bamboo, not fully formed paper but on bamboo strips. In tombs like the one of the marquee e of the state of zone. And whether it's by the fact of the sort of structure of the organization of the strips. Or by other means languages now be organized into full columns that are more or less regularize, that has characters have more or less the same size as the repeat. Which is again not the case in this early phase of writing with the Shang dynasty writing. And we can again think about the development of writing systems. So in our modern simplified characters, which are the ones used in mainland China. They're derived originally from that kind of language we first looked at, right? Oracle bone script, which is much more visual. You can see a fish here. But as that character develops through various phases of writing development and technological refinement, you get these later forums which don't look as much like their original sort of pictographic styles that we see in oracle bone script. The script that dominated in the Han Dynasty among official texts is called clerk script or clerical script. And it's much more square then the modern script that become standard. And that takes over what we're engaging with with our piece of calligraphy today. It's called running script. And so it's less formal than the clerk least script or the clerical script used in court documents during the Han. And what happens is between each of the strokes of the character, you don't always lift up and differentiate or separate each stroke. You get instead a kind of running between of the strokes. And so it's highly personalized, less formal than the clerical script to used in formal documents in early periods. And then you can eventually get this running script, which is sometimes barely even sort of legible. Or you have to learn how to read the conventions of this very cursive script. So the scripts system develops and it's important to emphasize some of the basic elements of writing in chinese, as are discussed in the very early text I gave you, lady ways, battle formation of the brush, which is one of our earliest texts about thinking about what calligraphy is and how it conveys things other than just the content of your writing. So in the diagram at the battle formation of the brushy Lady way talks about the basic strokes that go into creating any character, right? You have horizontal strokes, dots, vertical strokes, long strokes that lift off at the end, the left ones that end a hard with a kind of tail to the right. One is that bounce up from the bottom and then ones that come down and then hook up. And that the combination of these strokes together you can get mostly every, every character. And she describes these strokes in the texts that you read. For this particular segment with interesting metaphors that are natural metaphors, right? The seven strokes are described as cloud formations, falling stones, Erebos, tusks, valine. And so in the same way that we're getting the nymph of the law River as this kind of natural phenomenon. The river personified in human forms. The basic strokes of writing are understood through similar natural metaphors as well. And this is some, one indication that we're thinking about something very different than the kinds of writing that most of us in the modern era Think about. This sort of poetic metaphor, a natural metaphor that goes into just a horizontal line, right? For those of us coming from a Western kind of writing. It's a right. If every time you crossed your TU thought in the metaphorical terms of a cloud formation that stretches for 1000 miles. That doesn't have It's it's indistinct, right. It's it's not clear, hard form, but it's not without form. Sort of in-between this have a beautiful horizontal stroke. You begin to think of writing in terms that are calligraphic. That is to say it's not just simple conveyance of ideas. There's art in the writing itself and metaphors and the writing itself. Or the dot. Very simple, just sort of a, again, from our western perspective, over the I write like a stone follow from a high peak, bouncing and crash and about to shatter. There's a dynamism to each of these strokes that is about contained energy and about natural metaphors as well. And we get both natural metaphors describe and Lady ways, battle formation of the brush, and also a way of seeing calligraphy, which is very bodily. So the metaphors that are bodily that she talks about include things like bone and flesh. She says those who are skilled at imparting strength to their brush have much bone. Those are not very skilled. Have flesh. If you have too much bone and too little flesh, that's not great calligraphy, we call that sinewy. If it has a lot of flexion, very little bone to it. That's called being an ink pig. And both of those are bad things. You want just the right amount of bounds and bone flash. And so that tells us that the way in which these characters are viewed as also like your viewing little bodies in motion that have natural metaphors to them. And also these physical characteristics like their breathing bloody figures, right? And bone and flesh is generally thought of in terms of your directionality of your brush. And then how long you pause with that brush in one place so that the ink absorbs into the paper, that's your flesh. If you linger too long in one place with your brush on the paper, the paper continues to wick out moisture and you get a big blot. That's what Lady way would colony pig, right? If you are not lingering long enough, if your brush and not making enough context to ink comes out of a into the paper. You're just gonna get a very scraggly little line which she's going to call sinewy. Alright? And so one of the fascinating things about calligraphy at this early period. Is that it's basically like watching the footsteps of a, of a dancer. You might think. It's the marks of a body in space. Pause at certain moments. The accelerated through other moments in the basic composition of words. And even at a very early phase, that's how people were looking at and understanding writing of calligraphy, especially in a Six Dynasties Period where these theories come up. And another way in which you can think about watching someone's calligraphy as like watching the moon in time and space, even if that was 1500 years ago, is the fact that there is a specific stroke order to Chinese characters. So word-like Xi'an, which means scattered, has to proceed in a certain order. You know, the first stroke is this horizontal, and then you get these two verticals than this next horizontal. You get this vertical and then this hooked vertical. A quick double dot here is abbreviated as a single line before it moves into the next aspect of the character. And if you didn't have that order to the strokes, you couldn't follow somebody's process of creating it, right? So you're following somebody's brushed process and the way in which they're thinking, moving and pausing as there write it. That's how you view calligraphy like this. Again from the upper right hand corner. So we're starting here with the date moving down in columns. But not just word for word in terms of their content, but stroke for stroke in terms of the movement of the person who made it. And in that sense, viewings about Reem body in motion, Reem body in action, and Reem body and thought. Which is partly why you get these bodily metaphors. I see a hand was raised by Vivien. Do you want to write your question in the chat it in? Or if you don't have a question, if you accidentally raised your hand, then we can move on to the next slide. Okay, mistake, that's cool. So again, one of the things a lady ways battle formation of the brush teaches us is that you look at this calligraphy not just as for its content, but for the art full construction of each individual word and the words in relationship to one another. So pause another moment here and think about this text is very important content, right? To this texts that we're thinking about. Just artfully, what is actually happening in this text. What does this text about? And when you've figured out what the text is about, go ahead and write it in the chat window. Roce, No, there's no punctuation. Classical Chinese is not punctuate. You have to know based on the grammar where thought ends and begins, which is what makes the study of premodern Chinese very difficult. Great. I'm getting lots of really great engagements with the text editor all very writes in the sense that, I mean, just grab a couple of more. So what we're getting here, just in terms of structurally what this is. Let's see. Ana pointed, pointed because it had no Kayla. This is a poetry gathering, right? And the gathering is documented in the book that followed this preface says Hannah describes right, this is to preserve the writing of the people who got together on this day in the ninth year of the Yung Ho Rain early in the very last month, spring. So what this is is just the prefacing several pages to a book that followed that included all of those poems. I actually don't have the poems anymore. What we have is this preface. The preface tells us about what happened on that day. And as many of you rightly pointed out, this is just like we were talking about with Six Dynasties Period in relationship to the cool kid you're painting. And that's Algeria poem. Feelings are very important here. And this starts off happy, right? Dina pointed that out. Drew, you talked about the kind of luxury of, of this event. This is a really fun day where the sun is shining. Nature is outside, right? And it's very beautiful. As let's see Kyle and said, this is Bachelor of connecting to the natural world around us. But then there's a kind of shift that happens. And before I get to that shifts. All right. Several of you pointed out that there's a purification ceremony here. I think I've written down as, as writing that this is a Taoist ceremony. This that is performed at the very end of spring as a kind of purification that connects a little bit to some of our kind of more self in interested religions like Buddhism and Daoism. And so this gathering is initiated as a kind of on a ritual day for this Daoist purification ritual. And then they start to drink, enjoy the sunshine, really enjoying each other's company, and start to write poems, right? But then as all of you also got to, there's a shift that happens in the middle of this realization, right? That basically that we all die. So they're in the middle of having this party with this purification ritual, or they're having a great time there, getting a little drunk. They're writing poems to one another to kind of show off how literary they are. And then. Won't she has this feeling like, wow, this is fantastic, but not every day is like this. We all die. And then that leads to, as Matt put it, depression is quote unquote, a kind of sad, melancholy, right? And there's a shift in, and it becomes very nostalgic, which was Ethan's word for it. And diarrhea pointed out that mortality is really at the center of this, right? And the question of how we live on after we die, and the issue of not being able to enjoy pleasure all the time, having kind of dark days and difficult days. And that you don't always get wonderful moments for all your friends are together to celebrate this Taoist ritual and drink with you and enjoy the sunshine. That eventually all of that goes away and the ultimate way and we, we pass away. But, and this is where the end of the kind of right in ties everything off the way around that as Hannah pointed, life ends but are writing goes on. And so each of these moments kind of points to one of those ideas you have this beautiful day, everyone around you is having a great time. You're having a drink at the party or writing a poem. But depression inevitably follows this realization that not every dance like this, where are our lives ultimately come to an end? There's no escaping that pain. And then he switches by assembly time I examine the causes that bring about emotion and men passed. So this is crucially, he goes to ancient poems to look for that same sense of nostalgia as you described it, of sadness, depression, even in the face of beauty. And he founds that there's a kind of mirroring of his own feelings in the ideas of men of the past. And that leads him eventually to this idea that if I write these down, if I collect these poems, men in the future will done, will do as I have done. And read these poems and know of the kind of continued connection that they have to humans that have already died and are long gone. And it's through the writing that we stir these feelings of connectivity and this idea that we might live on after we die. And that writing is not just again about the content. That's also as I'm emphasizing here about the calligraphy itself and the idea that something of Wang Shi Jersey spirit, something of his existence in time and space is captured in the motions of his brush. And following those, you get to kind of re-experience Wang Shi Jie moving through these ideas as you're reading. And that brings us to this other idea. Many people like to jump onto the kind of conclusion that when emotion shifts as it does in the writing, in the middle of this piece of writing, of this preface. Calligraphy must get more expressive, it must get more agitated. But that's not necessarily the case. If we look at the very first character of this and I've mislabeled it here. It's not actually a poem. It's, it's, it's prose. Loopy at the first character, in the last character, they all have the same, or they both had the same kind of sense of separateness from the other characters. There's a little bit of connectivity between strokes, but it's not getting more emotional. It's not thrashing about the different strokes as the emotion kind of carries on. If we identify a passage like this passage here, as we let our eyes Rome and our hearts speed from thought to thought, we could experience the greatest delights of i an ear. And this was happiness, right? This isn't any more expressive, happy, or joyful than any of the other characters. And so the emotional change and content is not actually signaled in formal changes. The calligraphy or brushwork style. That's not where the sense of Reem, body being the feelings if someone from the past come from, it's a little bit more separate from that. Instead, as you follow each of these characters and each with emotions as the brush kind of gently lays down here, lifts up and then dots again, rushes over to this space where whoops, hooks back around before leading to this next stroke here and then this stroke, you're following the ideas sort of as they're being formed. And that is how you engage with calligraphy, like, like this. Through our writing, one sugar is saying and the content we live on. And through the principles of how you read it, look at calligraphy. You live on as well because people are, should Reem, body knew as they're watching each stroke and each character come into formation, stroke BY stroke. And so all of these ideas about cultivating your sense of self and your emotion, these natural and bodily metaphors of the looking at calligraphy and the idea that there's a sort of bone and flesh to the flecks of the brush and ink on the paper are all part of how this calligraphy is viewed. I've made it to the end of class with a few minutes left. Are there any questions or ideas you guys want to talk about? If not here, then can again put them in the discussion board. Let's see if I missed anything. This is all hangover from the last discussion. Any other ideas you guys want to talk about in our last few minutes of class? Right? So Gabby wants to know about bone and flesh. Again. If you go back to Ledi ways battle formation of the brush, she describes bone and flashes. These two kinds of bottling metaphor is another one of your key word. So Bowden flesh can fall under bodily metaphors that describe how you look at the strokes of calligraphy. And this really has to do with the dynamics of the brush, right? So as you're holding your brush, it is, it's got all these layers of That the hold several characters worth of ink. And as you flex and push the brush into the paper, which is very different than writing stylists like, like a pencil. You're getting more ink that absorbs into the material the longer you stay in a place, and more pressure you add, and Lessing, the faster or less pressure you use. And the bone is pretty much the sort of direction of the brush, right? If you drew a kind of straight line through where the brush went and the flesh is how much ink is coming out of it. So that has to do with how fast you're moving and how much pressure you are applying. And because of these principles, when you look at calligraphy, you can actually read, Imagine the motions and the pressures and the push and the pull of the person who originally made them. And this makes looking at calligraphy very different than looking at handwriting in the sense that we might be used to thinking of it in the modern era. Does that explain GAVI or do you like more and more details? So once you're sure, like Souter came from a wealthy family, he did for a brief period of time serve in government, but he had the means and the ability to kind of step away from that, to retreat to his family estate and to write poems and drink with his buddies. And this kind of idea that, that, that is a moral thing to do in the face of political instability or a government that is not demonstrating itself to be moral or true. That the, therefore the morally correct thing to do, to withdraw and cultivate yourself. That's sort of the idea we're associating with, with people like Wang Xi ger aren't or saboteur. And I wasn't brothers explicit about that relationship and the early iteration, I bet in this lecture. But he was a wealthy from a wealthy family and had the privilege to be able to step away from government work and do whatever you want. It basically, true thing guys, it looks like we're at the end of class and I have another class in 15 minutes. So I'm going to do a little bit a walking around to make my legs get some energy back in them. I hope you have a nice day and I'll see you on Thursday. Yes. Thank you.


## [05. Early Buddhist Art](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/05-early-buddhist-art?module_item_id=2446293)

 Let's go ahead and get started. First off, are there any remaining from last class that we want to clarify before we start in on today's class, will give you just a minute to write those in the discussion chat section of WebEx. So E is asking about the exam. The last slide again in this class, I'll go over the exam and I'll go over the exam as well, an overview class on Tuesday. But yes, it will be an online quiz through Canvas. So it should already be in your schedule listed as required assignment. You're going to go over the details of that at the end of class today, as well as on Tuesday when we review for the exam. Alright, if there's nothing else pertaining to last class, let's go ahead and get started with this class in which we're finally talking about a kind of integrated East Asia in the sense of China, Korea and Japan altogether and wound class and all treated equally. And this is the last class of our first module on Ancient China. And so these are the three objects that we're looking at today. And each of them relates to Buddhism. But I want to get us started by exercise. Again, our basic skill set here of visual analysis by thinking about stylus to comparison of these two. Chars, neither of which is one of your required sculptures. But by looking at these, we can begin to ask a few questions about how artworks relate to one another across time and space in the effort to convey certain kinds of messages. So using your chat function, compare and contrast these two sculptures. Try and find at least three ways in which they're similar and ways in which they're different. And then we can discuss this comparison between these two sculptures. As our x sort of kick-off to the class. All right, so we're getting a lot of really rich description here and I'm gonna sort of highlight or summarize all of them. Really participation as it wasn't able to get down. Everybody's name is, I was scribbling here, but you made some really wonderful observations here, beginning with some of the basic similarities which, which allow us to really think about, well, what is the relationship between these two beginning with, as you said, the pose or the posture, right? Or the were seated as another way to think about this, the way their hands are gestured, our gesturing, right? So the figure is seeded with one foot on the ground, or in the case of or actually not on the ground, that the foot is resting on a little lotus pedal, a little flower. The other foot is up over the knee and the other leg is bent. And one hand is on that ankle while the other is up at the face in a kind of gesture that seems very familiar to us, right? One of kind of thinking about, about something. And so everything about the posture is almost exactly the same. Seated one leg on, on lowest pedal, the other up on an E. One hand resting on the foot, and the other by the face in a gesture of a pensive gesture or thinking gesture. And then their faces are relatively similar in terms of composition as well. Very serene, right? The eyes are kind of half-lit, ID, a gracefully arching eyebrows down to a long nose and just pursed little lips and a slight smile underneath very long faces. I'm with long earlobes as well. So if we're just talking about their bodies, their position two the same. And they're very similar in terms of the way in which they're composed. Even down to the kind of sense of musculature as being somewhat language, we might say. Rather than, I don't know what the other word might be. Cut. These guys aren't hitting, hitting widget and you're Santa Fe fan here. So anyhow, that's what we're talking about, the sort of similarities and posture. Especially. You also talked about similarities in the clothing, right? These, both of these figures from the waist down are clothed in robes that seem to fold and rip an extraordinary amounts. Perhaps the material is a very fine material so that it has these kinds of folds and, and ripples in it. But each of them has kind of a long skirt from the waist down, and his bear from the chest up, and then as jewelry around the neck. For one and the other. And then we can shift to some of the difference has some some some different aspects to the jury. As many of you said, crowns and a jewelry or a little bit more ornate with the figure on the right, where you have these kinds of floral elements to what is otherwise just two simple bans, circular bands around the neck of the figure on the left. The figure on the right has a crown that has what appears to be other figures in it. And these backgrounds of these figures in the crown that are like the halo behind this figure on the right as well. And that's one thing you guys notice has a very strong difference. This halo with these floral designs wringing it, flower kind of behind it. And these large leaf patterns that extend out from it is one major difference between these two sculptures. And another major difference that we might talk about is the fact that as one of you mentioned, there's this sort of landscape flowing underneath here, a water escape. Even. You can see a flower here supporting that seat on which this figure sets. Another flower again supporting foot. And around it you get these sort of water, plants and flowing water as well here at the lotus foot. But none of this other kind of extra scenery. And that might actually relate in part to what many of you also notice is that the materials are very different. So this material on the right is stone, and this material on the left is cast bronze. And one of the things we can begin to think about when we compare the materials, especially is the process of making each of these objects are one of these is what we call additive and the art was part, sorry, this one and the other is subtractive, which is to say when you scuffled, you sculpt this object here on the right. From a solid piece of stone that you chip away at. You subtract from the whole stone in order to get to the final form that you need or wants to create. Sort. On the left is additive model was built up. And then Brahms was cast in that, in that form. And that's where you get a lot of the differences in structure. The halo would've have to have been probably casts separately and position behind. And it's possible this had a halo, this Braun's object on the left that's no longer longer exists relation to the sculpture. Whereas the halo here is all continuously part of the same piece of stone. You can see here that the stone is left between the body and the arm on this sculpture. And that there's a kind of squareness to this sculpture that is partly because of the fact that depending on the material, depending on the type of stone, he didn't to be very careful about leaving suspended elements hanging there so that the weight of the stone eventually it would collapse the arm. So this little piece of stone here is meant to support the arm as it, as it rises. Whereas in the bronze, you don't need to leave all that, all that stuff. And so. Part of the difference between the way these two things look is very much based on the technology used to create them. And yet the similarities are so strong. We have again the ask, how is it that these two things look almost exactly the same but have these very slight little differences. And what does that mean for where these are from and what they're doing? Coltan, thats a good question. How large these actually don't have measurements for this, but I would guess that each of them is around one to two feet high at most, but I don't have measurements for this, so I'm not going be solid on that comment. So again, what you should've begun to think about is if these two are posed. So similarly, if their body sort of proportions and shapes are so similar. And yet there are these slight difference. Does that mean there was some sort of originary or original kind of form that both our modelling themselves after. And the simple answer is yes. To a lot of religious sculpture. There are these sort of prime forms. And to convey a certain deity, such as a Bodhisattva, which is what both of these figures are. Within Buddhist iconography. You need to convey that figure with the same sorts posturing of body language so that they can be understood at different religion as the same figure. And we call this, these, these sorts of similarities. So we think about these similarities through the idea of, of iconography. Certain kinds of form, content or gesture. Try so the gesture of touching the face or the gesture of being seeded with one leg up and one foot on a lotus pedal. Form being the lowest pedal or, or the, the way in which the figure is dressed right, with certain kinds of jewelry and content. Relating here as well, creates a unified language between objects that might exist in different places and in time and style. The other word is where we might begin to think about the kinds of differences between these two objects. It's how those iconographic forms are manipulated, articulated in different ways, in different places and in different times so that the shape of the jaw line, one is much more square and the other is much more rounded. The way in which the body itself might be a little bit more fluid in language in the image above, where the simplicity as many of you described of the, of the ornamentation. If these are the same figure for both Bodhisattva's, then they ought to be carbs or cast with very similar kinds of, of jewelry. A Bodhisattva's within the Buddhist pantheon are kind of angelic creatures. Human with human form that are off, describe with intersex characteristics somewhere between a male and female body. And they guide the figures are people in the real world. To Buddha hood or to being like the Buddha. Whereas the Buddha is often conveyed in very simple forms without a lot of adornment or jewelry. Bodhisattva is get to have a little bit more bling. And you see that kind of in this stone figure, especially with its extra ornamentation in necklaces and part that symbolize that there's still attached to the real world. There are still present in the real world to help guide people through these sort of difficult questions that face them. One of the things, again, that I've been trying to emphasize in this discussion is that through the similarities, both iconographic and the way they're positioned and composed and the different kinds of forms we see then that the lotus is the crowns, et cetera. And they're stylistic similarities. That is, the proportions of the body is the kind of language form. The more or less similar faces, leads us to believe that these two images, these two carved and cast images, might have a kind of very near common ancestor. And in fact, both of them as the last label I think, showed R from a somewhat similar period of the late sixth century, but one is from China and one is from Korea. Both of these though, are meant to convey the ideas of Buddhism. So whereas the iconography and certain stylistic characteristics of the sixth century unite them in their mission to convey Buddhist ideas to, to practitioners, to viewers. This slight differences mark those being made in different places by different people, but slightly different visual preferences. And this is one of the, again, the key tools of art history is visual analysis and comparison. Thinking about how objects are similar and different and what that tells us about whether they're trying to convey the same message and from perhaps even the same geographic or historical places and periods. So let's get a little bit of background to you that was a really productive, I think, discussion comparison between these two objects. And that's one of the kind of main tools in the toolbox of the art historian. Close comparison, thinking about materiality, thinking about visual differences, and the iconography of objects, especially religious objects. But to give you a little bit of background here on the route of those two things we just looked at which or from the sixth century. And to think about their origins in a particular profit or figure, religious figure from about 1000 years earlier. Siddhartha Gautama, also known as Shakyamuni, the Sage at the Satya tribe or the lion tribe, or also known as just simply Buddha, Enlightened One. Buddha. Apathy came to me, was a historical figure. Supposedly prints within the socket tribe. And he, like many of our profits at the origins of religion, was disturbed by the world around him and wanted to change it. He was someone born integrate privilege which he renounced, according to Buddhist more according to Buddhist myth and legend, he renounced his prince They status in order to become a static, someone who lived off of the land and in the words like a hermit and meditated on higher ideals, such as the purpose of being and the nature of life itself. After an extended period of fasting and meditation, the Buddha became enlightened. And some of the ideas that are at the root of very early Buddhism or ideas like the Four Noble Truths. Some of the ideas that came away from this initial stage of intense meditation with and these are reformed the ideals of Buddhism. And the Four Noble Truths go more or less like this. You have pain and suffering, and frustration and anxiety in life and that is something that is unescapable. The reason why I have pain and suffering, this is the second sort of stage of logic is that you desire thing. So you have attachments to people, to pleasures, to stability, to ideals. And when you can't get those things, you have pain and suffering and anxiety, et cetera. And then the horrible truth shift to what you can do about it. The fact that you can understand what your weaknesses are, what your attachments are, and you have the ability to overcome them. And then the last of these four noble truth that there is this eightfold path that takes you to that way of overcoming or surpassing your attachments that cause you pain. And we'll go through the whole path step by step. But the idea essentially here is to overcome your attachments to the material world in a way that leads you eventually to a kind of enlightenment and a stage of enlightenment called nirvana, which is freedom from the cycle of rebirth. Buddha comes out of a Hindu sort of background in it's understood that you are reborn again into different bodies after you die. And within the Buddhist sort of outlook, that cycle of rebirth is something that you eventually want to transcend entirely. Carma, which is a word that many of you have probably heard before, often translated as a kind of fate or the outcome of your actions, is what determines how you were born in the next life. And how you, how you are reborn again reflects how essentially how good you were in your previous life. If you are a terrible person, you might get reborn not as a person but as an animal. If you were particularly good person, you might be born into a kind of higher state of awareness or status. And the goal eventually is to overcome all the attachment within, within Buddhist faith to the world's in order to transcend into a kind of being outside, being into a heavenly paradise. And so that again, is sort of prefaced on doing good in the world. Giving freely of, of what you have, helping other people, et cetera. And again, I'm not being anxious, desirous, and letting those kinds of emotions guide you in your decision-making. Now the and then again, this makes this religion a little bit different than some of the other religions we've talked about so far, like the ritual ancestor worship of China or the Taoist sort of worship which is about the environment and natural phenomenon. This is much more of a psychologically based religious group or philosophical ideas. It's about yourself for selfhood, and how you can be a better person as separate from your attachments to and history or to these other kinds of metaphysical or ethical philosophies that we might think of with the early philosophical period in China. Now, this group of ideas begins in the fifth century BCE in what is now the foot of the Himalayas in northern India and Nepal. And you can see that sort of that's colored here being the area of origin around the fifth century of these Buddhist ideas. The Buddha Shakyamuni, also Siddhartha Gautama, conveyed as ideas and gathered a large following. And these followers helped to spread his ideas after he passed and transcended the cycle of rebirth into nirvana and went into the kind of a heavenly around. Just like other major religions that the profit stab disciples that then carry on these ideas. And for several 100 years, Buddhism operated mainly in Nepal, in northern India and in the regions around it as a kind of new set of religious ideas and it, and it appeal to all classes of people anyone could obtain enlightenment as long as you sort of revoked your attachments to, to the world and started giving back and away. But there's a crucial moment where Buddhism begins to spread much more widely. And again, this is true for almost all the major religions. And that is the moment when government, our political body, co-ops the ideas of the religion, commits to the religion as state religion and then uses the state enterprises to help spread that religion. And with Buddhism that happens in the third. Century with a King, Ashoka as great in who ruled in an area that's now part of northern India. And he made Buddhism part of state religion. He sent missionaries abroad and help to develop and proselytize really that is, spread the ideas of Buddhism through again, the mechanisms of the state. With this spread, again, you're talking a couple of 100 years after the original Buddha has died. Of course comes Different kinds of, of obligations. Obligations that tie religion and politics. Together. They become various different ideas about what original or true Buddhism is. And that's where we get the development of different kinds of schools or sects of Buddhism. Sc t. Just like there are many different sects or divisions or schools of Christianity or Islam, et cetera. But this sort of branch of Buddhism, it spreads the most widely. It's called Mahayana Buddhism. That is the Greater Vehicle. Mahayana translates to from the San Script. And that's because as the ideas of Mahayana Buddhism didn't require you to completely give up everything in life. You can still be a farmer. You could still be a business person or a merchant and potentially obtain enlightenment. And being a practitioner, you didn't have to revoke everything, become anesthetic or a monk in order to be enlightened. And as you follow these paths on this map, you see eventually how over the next millennium. But isn't this spreading to areas of China, Korea, and Japan where we'll begin to look at it. So this is all background information about the spread of Buddhism, beginning with the Buddha and 500 BCE, the adoption of Buddhism as part of state religion in northern India. And then again, the division of Buddhism into a variety of different belief systems and different branches. Most of what we'll be discussing falls under sort of Buddhist schools of Mahayana, the Greater Vehicle Buddhism. Because again, it was more accessible than other sorts of Buddhist schools with Buddhist art. To give you guys a little bit of a background for that. Early Buddhist art did not represent the human body. Just as a lot of early religious art did, did not start. So there wasn't a Schekman representation of the Buddha until a slightly later period, early iconography. That is again, the kind of symbols or forms that conveyed certain ideas and ideals of Buddhism included the lion. Because the original Buddha, Shakyamuni, Siddhartha Gautama. Came from this shock at tribe. That's where the idea of Shakyamuni or the name Shakyamuni comes from, which was the lion tribe in his region. The wheel, as you see on this pillar top, representing the cycle of rebirth and the idea that again, the goal is to increase the better yourself so you escape the cycle of rebirth. The lotus flower, which you've already seen in our comparison. Because the lotus is a plant that thrives in muddy swamp and swamp like environment. But when it comes out at the margin, the MAC, it's petals are repellent and bright and beautiful and so become symbolic of overcoming attachment to the muck and the grime and the disgusting and the world. And then the pillar upon which all of these early icons, iconographies stands. Often. The pillar being the kind of symbol for the stability of the ideas of Buddhism. So this particular image here, this sculpture comes from northern India from that period of Ashoka THE great. And it was one of the X by which he used to buy which he spread or the Buddhism with inscriptions about the Four Noble Truths on them and this sort of symbolism at the top. But when Buddhism begins to spread to Central Asia, it intersects with the Greco-Roman figures coming out of the Mediterranean and Greco-Roman art forms coming out of the Mediterranean world in the third century BC, all the way up until the third, fourth, fifth century AD. And that's why you get figures like this, which come out of, it's now modern Afghanistan and Pakistan. From this first, second center, which appeared to have the same kind of body positioning as Greco-Roman sculpture. That has a contrapposto stance with the hips in one direction, the shoulders and the other. And fully figured forms. It's with this section and other kinds of visual cultures that Buddhism becomes figured. That is that you get the ideal forms of the Buddha himself and of the various bodhisattvas that we've already seen. And so again, following these kinds of trade routes, you get the path of Buddhism through various regions that already are their own visual cultures. And in order to communicate with those cultures, the visual aspects of Buddhism began to change. So as Buddhism moves into the region that we're interested in. So this is all prefacing material right? Into the sites that we're thinking about. That is Dunhuang, where our first set of frescoes, of Buddhist murals are. Korea, where in the eighth century we're talking, you know, a kind of cave temple or artificial cave temple called Jerome. And then in nada, where the imperial family in Japan in the early seventh century begins to advocate for Buddhism. We're following the pathway of people, of objects and of texts through the ancient world. Buddhism first arrived in China. If we're talking about East Asia over land. And then eventually by C in the Six Dynasties Period or in the later Han and then it takes root in this exchanged period. Remember the Six Dynasties Period that we talked about last class is a period of relative disunity where you have different smaller kingdoms ruling in the north and in the SAT. And Buddhism especially takes root in the various kingdoms of the north. And so a lot early Buddhist that's in China are in this region here of the trade chord are known as the silk road between the northern part of the Tacoma kind of desert and in what is now Western China, but was not part of China at this point. And sort of heartland and northern heartlands where you have these different northern kingdoms in China. And just as with the origins of the kind of initial exponential spread of Buddhism, it, these various kings and queens of the northern kingdoms in China adopted or patronized Buddhism. And patron is just a fancy word for somebody who pays the bills. Somebody who helps out by footing, footing the bill Israeli for creating temples and other spaces that helped to spread Buddhist ideas. So you have kings, queens patronizing temples and temple caves like the one we'll look at in a minute. And you have as well helping to spread these ideas. People who committed themselves entirely to Buddhism. And perhaps one of the most famous early monks in Chinese history has Shenzhou. Shenzhou was certainly origin figure for a later set of mythical tales called The Journey to the West, which has been fictionalized in a variety of movies, cartoons, and books since the later period in China. And you take some kind of supernatural characteristics. But it wasn't actual monk who traveled all the way back to India in order to study or original, but which meant learn several different languages that has original Chinese. And then brought those ideas all the way back to China. And again, this is a 1000 years after the Buddha lived. And so these questions of, well, where's true Buddhism and where does it lie, motivated Some people like trends on to go back to learn about it in its original spot. In northern India. Pilgrim is there and then bring those ideas again back into chime and to retranslate very early texts. This is the equivalent of doing a kind of birthright or trip to Jerusalem. Whether you are Christian or Jewish or taking a trip to Mecca, right? It's about kind of reconnecting with the origins of the profit that was at the root of your religion. So you have lots of different ways in which. Spreading. And we were intersecting with our first object, a set of murals at this particular sites. Some of you may have been lucky enough to travel here. The logout caves at a city called Dunhuang, which is here in the map of China. So far Western China are a set of carved out caves from a sandstone wall of, of sort of solid stone that date anywhere between the very early phases of Buddhism in the fourth century up until the 14th century. And at this point, Dunhuang was a major trading hub between China and Central Asia and South Asia and then basically the rest of the world. So it was a trading depot. And that meant there was a lot of money here. And get a lot of different kinds of patrons in these early caves. Various rulers of the Northern Kingdom, various princes and princesses, even lower folks like dukes or merchants, just people with lots of extra money, would pave artisans for the bin of these temples and would pay monks for the consecration of these temple. And then for these things wasn't just about demonstrating how the UR, It, did you good in the Buddhist system of thinking at this point in that you got what was called aerate. And the idea of accumulating mare through your good deeds is related to the idea of building karma and good karma that helps you to escape eventually the cycle of rebirth and find your way into a sort of Buddhist paradise that's free from the pain and anguish of life. And the more you help to spread Buddhism. Lavish construction of temples or Shrine is like these at Dunhuang. The more merit you've got already about 1000 years after the book was originally preaching his ideas of non-attachment and about giving up here sort of material goods that you're, you're getting a little bit of deviation from some of those original ideas where it's okay for rich people to pay their way into heaven through helping to spread religion. And again, this is not unique to Buddhism, exists across the board and religions. And our first site is a painting in this cave. And this is a sort of complete view of the cave. Is given a, a number, modern number K 428 at the palm, and it dates to the Northern Zhou period. One of these very short, you'll see it's only 24 years long. Northern dynasties. And it was patronized by the rulers of the northern Joe. You can see that again, the whole space is carved out of raw sandstone. And the walls are painted in what's called fresco technique. And we'll get to that in a minute. But I'd like to do is take us to. A kind of walk through the space. You get an idea of what actually being in that space is like. Let me share with you a minute. Just patients from up. We should be seeing this. I hate all the kind of mumbo-jumbo music. But sudan. So right in here is where we're entering into the cave that we're talking about. And as you can see, the cave wouldn't have been not fully lit, except from whatever natural light was coming in from the outside world to seeing with a flash that actually more or less approximates how often that the original viewers would have seen it with the kind of lamp or candlelight as they entered into this cave. As your interim straight into the A7, you're confronted with this column. It's again carved out of straight sandstone with stucco sculptures pasted on top to give that sort of sculptural form of these Buddhas. Bodhisattva as monks and guardians. And on the walls are all painted in fresco. And again, you can see that when you're walking into this space, it, it actually imitates timber architecture, right? You can see it is Bruce beam here with these side beams coming off of it, all painted into the ball. It's not real structure, but the facsimile of structure through fresco painting with these heavenly sort of beings and floral designs decorating the roof. And then as you move to the left, you eventually come across are fresco. Again, looking at the roof, the flying DD, Bodhisattva's and Apsara has also like heavenly beings, exotic animals like peacocks. And if I can skip ahead to it here. X2 you entered this is the entry way. And these are pictures of the donors here. You get are fresco here on the left. And so with that, I'm going to switch this back to our PowerPoint. But that was again to give you an idea of the way in which you would enter and actually interacts with the space in which we're looking at just the one just the one. I'm trying to share the buddy asked and I can't seem to figure out a way to unshare it. Can you confirm that I'm only showing you the PowerPoint at this point are forced to see both this and the YouTube. Suddenly the PowerPoint. Okay, thank you very much, appreciate that. So back to the PowerPoint. And again, you will have entered into the cave, you see that kind of pillar to begin with. And then what you get is on the left-hand side, one particular set of images. And this is where I want to pull out our first tech stretch. I gave you a text called The Prince gives his life to figure. And that's the story we're seeing here on the left. How is this a toll visually as compared to this story, which is Taka tail to talk a tails are the lives of the former Buddha. So remember that the Buddha is talking about enlightenment and escaping the wheel of rebirth. Part of the kind of narrative storytelling that happens with the expansion of the Buddhist sort of faith or stories of the lives of the Buddha lived before he became the Buddha. And this is the stories, that's what Jude talk a tail is. So where are we seeing the story play out and how is it being told on the wall to the left on K 428 as compared to what we're getting in the whoops, I skip down a little bit. Yeah. Oh, great. So you guys are all getting the structure right on these kind of three register in which we're getting actually from right to left, left to right and right to left again. There's that, there's a kind of zigzagging action happening in the story. So it's a little bit different than some of the narratives that we've seen so far. And here you see the princes taking off and we know that this is the beginning, cuz all three of them are present and moving through the landscape as they go hunting. Here's the scene of the hunting as, as many of you said, I think Mindy is hunting on top, Tigris in the middle, and then the recovery of the body on the bottom right. And here's where they stop all three of them. And that stopping is figured partly by the kind of momentum and directionality of the bodies, right? All three moving in the same direction, all through moving the same direction while one sleeping in hunting. And then they stop and face each other, right? And we see them moving through the landscape with a spot for the first time. The hungry Tigris here, with all of the Cubs starving at the bottom of this sort of Mountain. And the three of them sit and discuss it. Two of them leave fray. And you have the moments in the story in the middle here with that, with the princes sacrificing himself. And this is a pretty gruesome store in fact, because there are two moments to the sacrifice, right? The Prince throws his body the first time. And I think cherry to, you're giving us this. Great. The Tigris looked like she was new death. And the third brother offers to stay behind and sacrificed his life. And that's exactly the moment that we're getting here. And the first time he offers his body, the Tigers is so weak that she can't actually be bothered or find the energy to eat him. Do he brings himself up to a tall cliff, throws himself off so that his body breaks. It eventually breaks all of his bones and is bleeding. And that allows the Tigris to then consumed his body. Not necessarily. Pr is dead meat much-needed Access. She didn't have the MD Matt tearing apart. So exhausted she was and so you get this sacrifice, but also this kind of double sacrifice rate. The, the idea that it doesn't just offer his body, he goes for the extra effort of kind of serving himself up with the blood and meat already slightly ripped open. And when the princes come back, just as you all mentioned, all they see bones here in the foreground. And again, the image should blow up a little bit larger. You can download it from the file on canvas. And t that, you know, there are these bones here and the figures are distraught right there. Hands are up in the air and they're upset. They traveled back to this how hone, right, which is figured here and then again here. And then decide to create a shrine to their brother. And you already see prefigured the kind of future of who this person will be when they're reborn in the next life. In the iconography of the Buddha seated on a kind of notice throne. So our near here works really similar. The two, the hands scroll in that you get a continuous landscape tying together and framing these different events. The mountains and the trees, framing the discussion of brothers, framing them moving through the landscape and hunting. And then having them stop. And, and discover again this sort of space here carved out of the landscape where the Tigris is. And these moments of, of different time in the narrative are broken up by landscape. As it zigzags from upper right, left, and then from the middle, from the left to the right, and then from the right to the left. Again. And as some of you mentioned, and I think Julian mentioned, this would actually be sort of hard to tell what was going on if the story wasn't known. But it, uh, the landscape with the repetition of the characters and the repetition of certain kinds of iconographic elements helps you to realize basically what's going on, right? These three brothers moving, hunting, stopping, and meeting the tiger. The tiger again, the tiger eating the body that's been thrown off the cliff. And it would also help people to tell the story to the uninitiated, right? And so what exactly is this story about? What's the moral here? Why would this be in a Buddhist cave with the sort of central pillar, Buddha and the Guardians and all the rest of the Buddha's around it. Here's a hint that the moral of the story is not, do not play with tigers. Right? It's about realizing that other living beings, including animals. If you can offer something that you have to help the sort of greater of a mother and a group of clubs. Then, then you watch it, right? You give of yourself for the greater good in a way, right? And this idea of again, not attachment comes up just as he points out and is Ethan points out self sacrifice as Maggie is writing, right? This is about sort of the selflessness of, again, removing your personal need from the equation in order to help provide for others, which is one of the mechanisms and one of the ideas early Buddhism. And the idea here is that by doing such a thing, you demonstrate your Buddhist ideals, right? And that eventually you will come to Enlightenment like the Buddha does, right? Because this story, this prints a former life of the Buddha. That's what these taka tales Tell. And by modeling was kind of good behavior in these former lives. You get exemplary kinds of Buddhist behavior being modeled in these, in these images gradient. And again, just to reemphasize with early narrative in China, right? This cave here is from the, from the late sixth century. And our painting, originally as a fifth century painting, were getting similar uses of landscape to help unite multiple narrative moments and to tell stories. Landscape helps to frame it and also helps to bind different moments in time with the repetition of these characters who are seen as the same because they appear the same way every time with the same features. So that's our first example of Buddhist starts and let me backtrack. I forgot to define what a fresco painting as. So, a fresco painting is a painting that is done directly into the wet, stuccoed, raw surface of a wall. So you prepare the wall, make it flat, and then add a kind of binding agent of stucco that is also flattened and a pure white paint. Wow, that stucco is still wet with these pigments. And in that way, the pigments bite and directly into the surface of the wall of the cave. And it helps to make them stay, rather than sort of painting over it in new pigment. Many of the colors that you see in this fresco or not, as they originally would have been. They've oxidized over time. So many of the mineral elements that were iron in them have gotten sort of deep brownish color but would have been a brighter red or even kind of an orange color. So again, that's what fresco painting as a new kind of technology that we're associating here, particularly with new technology to us that way, with, particularly with narrative religious art, art. Object O is. That's not a frescoes. But if carved granite stones composed together to create another cave-like space in what was then the unified sheila kingdom of Korea. So a little bit of kind of background here. As we discussed very briefly before. We haven't really checked with interject. We haven't really intersected with early history in Korea as a, as of yet. Because many of the things we want to talk about, we could talk about with a continuous development of, of ideas just by focusing on China. But Korea and Japan share quite a lot of common ancestry up until China begins to unify and the harm in, at the moment in which China begins to exert much more of a greater regional influence. The Korean Peninsula at this time, it's divided into three different states that go Goryeo or the old Goryeo state in the north, which is part of what's now northern China and North Korea. The Schiller kingdom in the center peninsula, and the Baekje Kingdom in the South. That's about the time we're intersecting at with it. The Shoah kingdom eventually conquers these other kingdoms and unify the peninsula. In, at the end of the seventh century with the help of military aid from China at this point. And this brings with it connectivity to the trade routes of China and to the ideas that are being put forward, especially in the northern parts of China, about an intersection of state religion, a religion and state of the Buddhist church, that is, with a politics of rulership. We talked earlier about the importance of historical documentation right, of writing in any given period. And our earliest written documents in Korea happened at around the fifth century CE. So much later than in China. And those early documents are actually written in Chinese script. And this is an interesting sort of complication to early language throughout East Asia. And it's true as we'll discuss eventually of Japan as well. And that is that the early writing systems of Japan and Korea are, are actually the Chinese writing system which does not correlate directly to the spoken system. But needless to say, to be literate incur, at, at the time that we're talking about when Buddhism arrives. Meant to be able to read and write in Chinese characters. And sort of that connectivity is happening partly because of the translation of Buddhist documents into Chinese. The earliest histories are actually written in the Korean language. Don't happen too much there in more of the medieval period. That is the 12th century. Some examples of early show tunes and the things buried in them. Jade and gold. Gold in particular was a major export of Korea at this early phase. When the early gold goods of China and Japan come from sources in Korea in the ancient period. So this is all kind of background. We're finally getting to sort of dig into Korean visual history. It's during the middle of the, of the Schiller kingdom when they've unify the peninsula. So this is after Schiller unification and governance. And the ways in which Buddhism is moving into the Schiller Kingdom at this point in Korea is through envoys that are coming from these northern kingdoms. So one kingdom will ascend an envoy or up political Messenger group that helps to create the trade ties between governments from these northern kingdoms to the Schiller kingdom. And even before the show, the kingdom unifies the peninsula. There were envoys moving from these various smaller states to the Spanish states of Korea. And so Buddhism is spreading through politics, through trade routes, through these various monks as well. And through the texts of Buddhism, which again are translated into enemies from the original Sand script. And then our Learn to be read in Korea through knowledge of Chinese texts. The earliest examples of Buddhism arriving in Korea are in the fourth century in those northern Kingdom, glory own Baekje. And many of the rulers of the states, just as Ashoka the Great did, they used Buddhism as a kind of leveraging tool to gain political power over the broader spectrum of their citizenry. And when you have a tool such as Buddhism, which again is, it allows enlightenment to happen across different spectrums of class and background. At allows you a certain amount of leverage against powerful aristocratic families. Whereas before religion and politics kinda become merged in this way with Buddhism. Much of politics was determined by political infighting and mare in-between wealthy landowning aristocratic families. The Schiller kingdom, which is again unifying all of B in the late 20th century and 68 AD, first absorbs and adopts Buddhism in the early sixth century. And through these exchanges have envoys of Buddhist texts between China and Korea. We can also follow the expanded use of ideas for written histories that are happening in Korea. Written again in the Chinese language. So this is a quick roughshod description of what culture is like and how it's happening in Korea, right? And our sights. The theorem Temple in Korea is made in around 750 AD. And there was a primary donor for this. Remember, we talked about the importance of donors. People who sponsor the production of important really diets for buddhist merit. And the primary donor for this site secure on temple or Grotto which has a cave, was the Prime Minister, that is the lead politician in the Schiller Kingdom. At this point, a man named Kim Dae Sung. And he constructed this temple site partly for the honour of his parents so that they would gain the merits are part of the marriage that he put into the construction of the site to help spread Buddha's for their own journey toward enlightenment. The site, as you are seeing it, is inside the temple space. And as you can see, each of these panels is one very large piece of granite that is carved stone. So rather than being carved out of raw sandstone, instead, we get these individual panels of granite, each card and then assembled in a kind of architectural space with the appearance of us beams and lintels. And here's a model of what that space looks like in order to create their dome over the Buddha. These Lynch pieces or keystones had to be dropped in, into the ceiling. And then this whole space is covered in earth. So it feels like an actual cave, but it's entirely man-made. With each, again of these large carved granite pieces acting like a part of a continuous ball and a keystone formations. You enter through a long rectangular Hall. And then you have these two pillars to the left and right. That marks off this circular space at the end where the large sculpture of the Buddha sits. Around the Buddha sit these heavenly beings that we first looked at with our initial comparison, these Bodhisattva's who helped to guide people in the real to better decision-making and toward enlightenment. They're like archangels. Essentially. There are fears, guardians that mark this sort of entry from the SquareSpace to the circular space. And then these very other kinds of deities, beings on the left and the right. And so you're passing from sort of people that you're more likely to see in the world toward more heavenly beings and all the way to the enlightened Buddha himself as you're moving through this keyhole space. We might be coming up on time. So I'm going to walk us through this visual analysis exercise, right? So what I wanted you to do is the same thing that we did at the beginning, which was to compare this space with this space. And to ways in which these sites are similar. Naturally they're both devoted to Buddhist religion, right? That's the sort of simple basic truth of these. Both of them have a kind of cave like shape to them. This one, though, is carved out of straight rock, sandstone. And this one is assembled covered with earth in order to produce a kind of appearance of being a caved. Both of them are man-made, therefore k structures, although it was slightly different technology. This is the decorations and the sort of iconography of the, of this cave as mostly painted fresco with some painted stucco or beings here and the center column. Whereas this space is all carved granite, which originally would have been painted in lavish colors. But time has sort of warn those away. It's also worth noting that both of them simulate timber architecture. So you have a roof, beam pitched roof that's not at all necessary in the cave at Dunhuang. And similarly here you have these lintels and cross beams that supposedly hold up a roof, but that's not necessary in the actual structure of this building. And so each of these allows you to think about what actual post and beam architecture would have looked like, and what temples that no longer exist, how they might have been constructed. But again, here you have facsimiles of timber architecture in man-made cave spaces. Each of which is contributing to the sort of practice of Buddhism. And therefore each of them, again is, is something we have to think about as sponsored by a patron, by a person paying for this Buddhist site. And the hope is that they'll get married out of it right there doing things within the Buddhist pantheon in order to help themselves alone to enlightenment. We know the patron of this cave, Kim Dae Sung, one of the prime ministers of the Showa period. And this cave was sponsored by the kings of the Northern dynasty. And so you're getting an association with rulership, but suddenly different people, right? You have a politician sponsoring this. And here you have the ruler of one of these short-lived dynasties sponsoring this cave? Yes, they were. All. The figures in this cave used to be painted but are no longer painted the painters or off. A lot of early sculpture, including Greco-Roman sculpture, was this way. Move us on so that we maintain time into our last object. And again, as we're traveling here along these trade routes, which is the same, which are the same routes at monks would have traveled or envoys would have travelled in order to move between various courts of these kingdoms in the north. Between China and Korea were following these trade routes all the way from Central Asia through parts of the heartland of China, through the trade corridor with the, with the Mediterranean world called the Silk Road, eventually to Japan, which originally gets its Buddhist images, it's Buddhist texts and its Buddhist from Korea. But then also is getting envoys and monks and various texts eventually from China directly as well. And so we have to think about who and what is causing this interaction of ideas as being wrapped up in kind of trade, politics as well. It's just a kind of pure religious zeal that motivates these people. When Buddhism arrives in Japan, it arrives during what we call the sukha period in which there is an imperial family that decides to support Buddhism as its own faith and therefore incorporates Buddhism into state religion. And what's important to notice here is that Buddhism is practice alongside other religions, not to the exclusion of other religions. So in Japan, you have a nativist religion that's in many ways similar to Taoism. Culture, which is about geographically specific religious sites. And really the deification of nature. Certain waterfalls or animals are given kind of spiritual form or seem to have efficacy in the real world. We won't talk too much about Shinto, but suffice it to say that Buddhism and Shinto existed alongside one another. And Buddhism eventually begins to co-op some of the ideas of Shinto. And just as with Korea, the texts of Buddhism and early writing. And that's how as it arrives in Japan is actually Chinese, the Chinese writing system. And it takes a while for that to develop into the Japanese writing system. Sort of precursor period that we haven't had time to touch on so far of sort of protocol. Historic Japan as it's often called. I involve a series of smaller kingdoms called the Amato hymns that had trade with Korea and, or the trade with China. Lots of exchange between the mainland and Japan. But Japan isn't quite unified in rulership until these, the period where we're beginning to intersect at, during these sukha period, following not a period. And again, we're defining history or historical Japan or historical Korea as when we get writing in order to document what these people actually thought and thought and felt about themselves. And we know that there was direct political, economic, and religious for the US with China and Japan at this point. That writing of course comes from China. And that even some of the ideas of Confucianism are coming from China. F is 0.2. Alongside Buddhism. I've got a random questions here. Still today maggie S people will sponsor or pay for certain things. Besides in order to receive merit, Kim Dae Sung, the Prime Minister in Korea, is not that person we looked at in the picture, no clear, that's a modern monk. Japan sent scholars to Chang'an to learn new, new things. Yes, there's an exchange even at this early time between Japan, Korea, and China. That's where we're getting this idea of envoys, right? An official group of people's scholars, politicians, et cetera, that connect one with another and create often trade agreements, but also helped to exchange ideas about religion. And so the object that we want to talk about with the early arrival of Buddhism to Japan is called the Chaka triad. It was made in 1623 and we have the exact date because of the inscription on the back, which I've asked you to read for today, is located in a city called data, which was the de facto religious capital of Buddhism in this early period of ancient Japan. This is a bronze sculpture with gold over top. So it's called guilt. Bronze medalist at the WHO DRG Temple in Norah. Nora eventually became the capital of Japan not long after this sculpture was made a couple of generations after the political capital. And in the period in the eighth century you get a real overlap again of politics and religion. The Buddhist church becomes a powerful player in politics. And just as she had mentioned, you have the capital, the layout of Norah being modeled after Chang'an, the capital of Japan, China, I'm sorry, fs time. And so we're seeing in many ways architecturally, in terms of planning, in terms of writing, religion. Lots of exchange between Japan and the mainland, China and Korea at this point. This is called the shocker triad because the figure in the middle is Shakyamuni, another name for the Buddha, another name for that Arthur Gautama. That is the historical Buddha figure who achieves enlightenment. And then you have to Bodhisattva's on the side. Again, these figures that are a little bit more adorned with extra jewelry, bigger crowns that have more bling as we say today, because it shows there. But a little bit more connected to, to the world. Even though they're one step shy of enlightenment themselves. And we have the Bodhisattva of wisdom and of praxis. That is sort of a fancy word for practice. It means a slightly different thing, but we'll leave it at that for now. Now the inscription on the back is for relates to a specific historical figure, a member, Japanese royal family person named Prince show tofu. It's often called the prince. And his role in Japanese history was not just as a prince or the imperial family, but it's one of the people who brought and, and, and was behind bringing Buddhist and Confucian ideas into Japan. He was responsible for sending envoys to China to bring back as texts, et cetera. And this particular text is really about the prints. And again, this, this idea of mirror trade, of accumulating good tea. It's promoting Buddhism as a way to lead to your own salvation. At a later period, Japan, the prince himself actually gets worshipped and that's when this sculpture is from the 13th century as a kind of deity himself because of his role in bringing Buddhism to Japan. Now on the back side of this halo, This is the image. Front is an inset inscription, and that's inscription I had you read for today. This inscription tells us not only the history of the object, but also the logic for why it was created the way it was. And this is one of the earliest and most extensive accounts of devotional practice that we have in Japan, dating again from 623, exactly because that's when it's David. You'll notice from the inscription that it is written in Chinese script. Again, early Japanese thing was written with Chinese script. Later on we'll talk about the shift towards Japanese writing system. But for now with guys with Buddhism, as with other early political documents in governmental documents to be literate in Japan, meant to write in Chinese script. And the inscription tells us a lot about how Buddhism is being used by the court. And if we add time, I would've wanted you to walk through the inscription. But as I've run this up against the clock, at the moment, I want us to sort of walk us a walk us through this. So it lays out a series of dates and events where the x and press, that is the mother of the prince dies. And then the prince becomes ill, as well as his concert, that is his lover. And they're confined to bed. Everybody else is very worried about the prints. And so they trust in the Buddhist law. Buddhism and the priesthood, referred to as the Three Treasures. By making a statue that was the exact size of the body of the prints. And that's important. It would be. So they create something in order to make the prints better. And they devote energy, time, and money to the creation of a Buddhist religious sculpture to accumulate merit, hopes of saving the trends. And so again, we can think about marriage and patronage as being interlocked. You don't just spread Buddhism for the fun of it. It helps you, in this instance hopefully to survive. But as we know, that is not what habit the princess passed away and so does the prince in 622. The following year, this vow to make a Buddhist sculpture of the Chaka triad is carried out. And the Buddhists officer made this inscription is put on the back. And the hope is that this will bring merit to both the empress, the old Empress, the prince, and his concert. Each of whom died, each of whom died from illness. And that this will eventually bring them to an awakening or to Nirvana. One of the other things mentioned in this sort of devotional texts is the sculptor. This is the first evidence that we have a name to sculpture in Japanese history as well. And so the information we get out of this is very much about how Buddhism is being used by courts to kind of create a overlap right, between the body of the Buddha, who was the central fee, the sculpture, and the body of the prince himself who dies. But remember the detail tells you that the body of the Buddhist sculpture is the same size as the body of the prince himself. So moral bodies or the royal family are being made like Buddhist bodies for the body of the Buddha. Therefore, if believing in the Buddha is a kind of way toward enlightenment, in part, at least for the worship of this sculpture, devoting some of that attention to the body of the prince himself into the body of the political rulers. Through stylistic comparison, we can think about the relationship between Chinese Buddha sculpture and this Japanese sculpture, especially through details like this very distinctive kind of patterning of the folds of these robes. And a square jaw on body positioning of some of the Northern Wei periods Chinese sculptures and Northern Wei was another one of these smaller kingdoms in the north. The inscription tells us we haven't named sculpture, Tory Bushi, Tory, the maker of Buddhist images. And he is actually the descendant of Chinese immigrants that come from China. Bring with them technologies that help and of images that look like, of course, Chinese images of Buddhist as well. They're bringing with them these artisans knowledge about how to make sculpture, but about also what good Buddhist sculpture looks like. And that's the lecture, I'm sorry, I've run up on time. But hopefully, if you have questions, you'll be able to put them into the discussion board, as well as to come to a review session next Tuesday for the first module exam. So I want you all to engage with the first module exam. Review, review your notes from these first five S's, and try and think of what sins you have. If you don't have any questions, we can write that down and that's fine. As long as you respond you get a point for doing this. Exam. Review this, this discussion, but it's required please. And then lastly, think about why we're grouping this chronologically has kind of ancient period. The module one exam directions are here and they are also posted on the exam. You will have all of next Thursday to starch and end the exam. You know, if 80 minutes to do so, we'll talk about the format next class. But in those 80 minutes or more, if you have extra time allotted to SDS, you will have multiple choice questions and a short essay question. I'll give you the short essay questions at the end of the module review from which one question will be chosen. I hope that's clear. I know I had to rush at the end and these four minutes I've gone over, but I'll linger for a minute or two for any other questions before I have to go to my next class. Otherwise, I'll see you on Tuesday. But Empire eggs. Okay.


## [06. Neo-Confucianism in China](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/06-neo-confucianism-in-china?module_item_id=2446312)
 Mm-hm. Mm-hm. And we seem to have a small class at the start today, but maybe more people come in and I'm to start. So just a few reminders. Thursday, your first short essay is due, and it's just a basic description. And then comparison with work We've already seeing people have already asked about the length of it. There's no specified length. It should not have to be too long, just like your essays in the exam. If you follow the rubric, you will do well. So just be sure to be thoughtful and follow the rubric as it is given. And you'll do just fine. One element I've added this year for the first time is peer responses. That way you're getting more than just my feedback in terms of how you're writing about the way you look at art. Your peer responses will be assigned automatically by Canvas the day after the descriptions do. Again, for your responses, just follow the rubric and you'll do well. They are completed within the short essay one assignments. But I will be grading them as a separate assignment mesh and the way that canvas works. So I apologize for any confusion that will bring, but you should be automatically assign somebody to write a corresponds to on Friday of this week, or any questions about any of that. Go ahead and use the chat window or come off mute if you want. When are that? Here's my error. Yep. You're responses do appear. Bounces are due on Thursday of next week, so weak after the description is is to thank you. Yeah. Sure thing. And answer Caleb's question. These things are all on Canvas in your assignments there on Canvas in your class schedule where they're linked and they're on Canvas and a variety of other places. I think you can you can link to them through the main page which has the schedule on it, or through assignments, et cetera. If you have trouble finding knows, you can just throw it back into the Chat window here. I think those should be available to you at this point. They're published on Canvas so they should be visible. Caleb, gives me, alright. I see one short essays like due this Thursday and witness and rubric to the bottom of the ISA, when you start writing it at the very bottom of the page, there will be or of rubrics that fell that shows what's expected. And do you see that? Yeah. But how do we respond with others? You yes. So that is in a separate assignment page. The separate assignment page for your peer response includes a new rubric. The rubric relates to what's required of you for the peer response. I'll have to see it. Okay. I bet. I can hear you about a that's fine. We'll just clarifying all of these things. It's good that you know where they are. Any other questions about this? And again, this is a large lecture course and I'm not in a right giant essays here, guys, I'm expecting you to engage with a short writing assignment, which is just based around describing what you see and trying to draw conclusions from it. It's just the kind of the basics of art history. And if you continue on with other art history classes, you'll get more involved writing assignments. For this class. We keep things pretty simple. All right, one other thing I'd like to say before we get started as just a PSA. For most of you, this might be the first opportunity you have to vote. And it may not be clear sort of how to go about doing that depending on where you're coming from. And I just want to encourage you all to exercise that, right. If you are an American citizen, you can register in your home state or an Ohio and all that is available on the.gov. I'll send this out an announcement as well. Just be aware that deadlines to register to vote vary by state. Ours is coming up quickly and Ohio, if you've already registered, then great. You might want to double-check with though to make sure that you are registered about your state website, but we'll show you where you registered to vote as well as where your voting location is. And so that's the first thing you need to do to register. To be able to voters, you need to register. You can't just show up the day off and do it. You should inform yourself about who you're voting for to the best of your ability, including whoever represents you now they're past record, as well as what the challengers policy platform is to change things. And that goes for all the races, presidential race, Senatorial race, if you're having wanting strict this year Representative race and even your state representatives as well. You can keep informing yourself by talking to people, by exercising your questions about kind of what people are representing. By looking at a variety of media outlets, not just the ones that we're used to hearing about and thinking about policy primarily. You may not like any of the candidates, but think about what policy they are putting forward. Some popularity contests so much as it is about changes to the life that you are able to live. And then lastly, when you've registered, when you thought about your representatives vote, you have a specific polling places assigned to you. And again, you can find those through a variety of mechanisms like the one I'm giving here. Or if you can't vote in person or don't want to During the covert era, apply for an absentee ballot and our state deadlines for this as well. So I would encourage you to do that now. So that is my bi-partisan announcement on how to vote. And I would encourage you all to give it a shot, especially since for most of you, it's your first chance to do so. Alright, class piercing done. We are moving on to a class in which when we're thinking about a kind of reaction against Buddhism in what we call neo-Confucianism, especially in China. But this idea and this group of ideas spreads to the rest. East Asia as well, that is Korea and Japan. Before, let's see if I can get my slides straighten out here. The two questions that we want to consider kind of most closely here when we're thinking about our first object. The reliquary of the Buddhist finger bone, is just thinking in terms of our visual analysis structurally. Well, what does this group of boxes which all fit into one another? What is this reliquary? Barnyard? Who exactly is it and how does it relate to the way in which it is you? Again, what can we tell just by looking at it and thinking about how it's structured. And then thinking about our kind of broader ideas. How does Neo-Confucianism relate to this object and to our next dog as well, the painting from the album by a painted by legal mean. So again, we're thinking about Neo-Confucianism, how it develops from the ninth century, we're encountering this object through into the Song Dynasty where we'll encounter our next object. But let's first start with a little bit of background before we go into visual analysis. So when I left you all off, which is again, a bit of a kind of a while ago at our mentally probably for you because you have been sending all last week for the for the test. But when I left you off, we had just talked about the kind of the spread of Buddhism in the way in which Buddhism and its various modes of travel help to unite people across languages and areas in East Asia. And it's where, where we think about kind of East Asia as a larger geographic WHO, through the ways in which we act, things like the spread of religion and other philosophical ideas are, or religious ideas across this space that recall East Asia focusing on China for this class. You'll remember that we left off China at the moment of that for disunity, right at a moment of a splintered group, regional rulers. And that's where we encountered our first Buddhists object the caves at Dunhuang under the Northern Zhou period, which was a regional rulership in the North. China gets reunified again, as you can see in this map, in the very short-lived Sui dynasty, Sui Dynasty is has its roots in one of these small kingdoms in the north than militarily and politically organizes to conquer all of the south and the north again. Rulers are the Sui Dynasty were Buddhist practitioners. And so Buddhism was incorporated in many ways into national politics just as we talked about in our previous examples of Buddhist art. The rulers of the Sui Dynasty attempted to reclaim all of the territory that had once been populated or, or a ruled over by the Han dynasty. And that was their ambition. And we're looking back toward the Han sort of golden age of unification and structure and, and rulership and of China. And they wanted to gain all of this territory is back, including what we think of now as Vietnam, parts of Northern Korea. And the military effort to extend the Empire to those extense led to an exhaustion of resources and to revolt and to the quick collapse of the somewhat short-lived Sui Dynasty. Tang Dynasty, which is the dynasty that rules for the next 300 years or so. It funded by one of the cousins of the, the, the last Sui Emperor. And so you can see that these politics are all quite inter, twined. And the Tang dynasty is a kind of golden age, just like the Han in Chinese history and art history. And the beginning of what we might think of as a kind of medieval period across East Asia. One of the hallmarks of the dynasty was a beginning of a shift toward away from aristocratic merit and toward intellectual merit for officials and to be assigned an official post. And simplify that with what that means is that whereas before your aristocratic status, what family you were born into help to. Are you a governmental post? And the land-owning families maintain their status by repositioning their sons into these official post. And it was mainly from these aristocratic families that officials were drawn. And some of the changes in policy for the Tang Dynasty in terms of officials taking their role was that you had to begin to now pass certain kinds of exams to show that you actually were intellectually capable of pooling over these sites sort of entry exams into civil service. And we'll see how that changes in the song and becomes more concrete. So that it wasn't just about, again, your, your status, your ability to rule as demonstrated through your intellectual capacities. Sd is an extreme cosmopolitan dynasty and connects really with the rest of Central Asia via the Silk Road. At the height of trade across Central Asia. There is a lot of religious diversity in the Tang Dynasty. And Buddhism is extremely popular again. It has sort of instigated and became part of rulership in many of the northern territories. But the connection with the Silk Road led to the introduction of a variety of other religions that we don't tend to think of. When we think of China, Chinese history, such as an historian, Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrian, MSM, Judaism and Islam, et cetera. The Silk Road trade across Central Asia and with the kind of heartland of China along the east coast was relatively secure at this point. Which led to, I'm gonna kind of flourishing of arts, culture and diverse ideas, especially in the early Tang Dynasty. Midway through the Tang Dynasty, there's a kind of a vec aren't changing pump with a rebellion led by Lu Shan. And afterward, the density isn't quite the same. And for the next several generations of rulership, you see a decreasing amount of economic and political stability in the Tang until it finally collapses in the beginning of the tenth century. And now during the Tang Dynasty, Buddhism the reaches its peak popularity. Brad across China. And encounters a kind of natural opposition, especially at court, which you should already be aware of, not only from previewing the vocabulary, but through your reading of the memorial on the Buddha's finger bone that Han Yu wrote to the emperor in the ninth century. One of the main reasons why there is this kind of opposition to Buddhism is that the church, just like churches today, was tax exempt and a lot of wealth was accumulated in the church. And as the Tang Dynasty begins to disintegrate, the tongue, Buddhist churches maintain a kind of well that is out of proportion with the rest of the country. And for the very end of the Tang Dynasty, I need 45. The Emperor Ku, excuse me, having inherited kind of disintegrating empire, decides to act on some of this opposition by seizing the assets of over 4 thousand monasteries and closing 40 thousand temples. As is described as a kind of persecution. But it wasn't a persecution in the sense of widespread genocide. The persecution of the Buddhist churches by seizing their assets and closing them down in order to help stabilize the Tung Dynasty in its later years. This is a really broad overview with a Buddhist focus on the Tang dynasty where we are encountering her first object. This is just a smattering of some of the other art forms that distinguish the tongue. The imaged on top is another of the caves at Dunhuang. Dunhuang is still an active site of worship and the logout caves at Dunhuang are still getting new caves sponsored such as this cave on top. And you'll see that the forums are growing even more lifelike, even more realistic you might think of in terms of the way and the drapery falls across the body. And the way the figures are composed, the tongue sons, a horse that you see at the bottom, sine psi as a description of the glazing is a kind of iconic telling dynasty. Objects in Tang Dynasty burials had massive sets of ceramic objects, much like the first emperor's tomb, but on a smaller scale. But again, a kind of increasing realism in the figure overrepresentation of animals and people. And then Tang metal work as well as very highly thought up. And you can see that in this very small little leaf shaped dish with its curling sorts of vegetal designs, which is a combination of gold and silver and a variety of different Silver smoothing and metalwork technique. The tongue is again a kind of golden age, rich with a variety of different material and visual culture out of which relate to Buddhism. And we don't have time for all of them here. Sadly, ABL we want to focus on is our set of boxes which was found at the bottom of this pagoda in the 19 eighties. This pagoda is actually much later that pagoda is part of Buddhist religious architecture. And it's, it looks like it has 1234567891016 different levels to it. These are actually all smaller than than than a real full height ceiling. And what that does is it creates this kind of ascension through the tower up toward the heavens. In each level of the pagoda was understood as a kind of level of existence toward the heavens. And so it's a kind of symbolic architecture, which we'll talk a bit more about when we get into architecture. Suffice it to say that this pagoda, which was a 16th century edition to an existing Tang Dynasty temple, collapses as you can see in that a large storm in the 19 eighties in stabilizing and excavating this collapsed pagoda or discovery was made under the Pagoda of a crypt, encrypted a sealed off room, usually containing the physical remained, as well as offerings to a specific body or, or, or person. And what was discovered underneath this pagoda, which again is a 16th century pagoda from the later Ming Dynasty, was a much older set of foundations to the Temple that dated back to the Tang dynasty. And in this crypt in particular, they found several chambers which had been sealed. And David in, in the, in the ceiling of these chambers to 874 during the very end of the Tang dynasty. And expressions reveal archaeological excavations reveal that the earliest moment when a temple here, it's probably the sixth century. But what you're getting here in the 19 eighties when this is the time capsule, takes you all the way back to 874, which is the last time a person entered into these various chambers with their objects buried in them. And so you're getting a kind of viewpoint back into the late Tang Dynasty. This chamber, which is the, let's see, which room is it at? The, I believe it's the second to last room is where we encounter our object that we're looking at today, buried with a bunch of other different things in this crypt and sealed. And 874 under the fouling Temple in Jiangxi Province. You can see that there are these two to1 guardians, a variety of other Metalware objects, plates surrounding this and then our box here in the middle. You'll see that the box once had around it a wooden outer structure. But over time, for 1000 years, the box disintegrated and fell apart. We don't really have any idea what that outer box looked like. But we do encounter of these eighth of these eight boxes that are nestled into one another at the center of this. Chamber under the foam and temple, again sealed and eights before. And that brings us to our first question. What does this box tell us about the way in which we're supposed to interact with it. What do we know about Buddhist practice, or can we think about Buddhist practice through just trying to ask what this, what this box is and does. So as your title or object says, this is a rela query and that's a kind of container that's built around a relic and built for the display and the care of that Relic. So that is what we're looking at. Relic of course, is an object from an earlier time that usually has a kind of bodily relationship to a holy figure. Often pieces of bone, tooth, sometimes hair, and, or hand or things that have touched. Holy figures are tutored. Relics. And our value within the religious system that supports those particular deities. And they become objects of worship and of veneration. And they accumulate around them things like rela queries, the sorts of housing or ornamentation to help display that particular relic. In this case, the relic purports to be, pretends to be that is the bone of the Buddha's finger. So just moving from the outside and I'm gonna walk you through these bot. So said they'll send out box that had that was made of wood. We don't know what was on that because it rotted away over time. The seventh box of these eight boxes that interlace as the first one that we come across. And on each face of the box. Yet one of the Heavenly Kings of the Buddhist kind of realm is heavenly King, often shown weapons and armor and flames behind their heads in their guardians to the Buddhists drown. They're often very fierce and angry. And there's one for each of the cardinal directions. So four of these kings. And here you can see it's silver as the base with gilding or gold over top to help define each of these figures. These fears guardian figures, as well as little flying up sorrows are angels here and various other kinds of auspicious animals on top. Moving to the next box. And this is what we want to focus on. We got a box, it's actually blank. It's just pure silver. And that calls are kind of attention to this box because it sticks out among the others as being completely an ornamental. So immediately you're kind of question marks should go off in your head. Why is this box on ornamented when the first box we come across is so highly ornamented or decorated. So keep that in mind as we move through this blank, complete silver box into the next box at this contains, we get a box that similarly in silver with guilt. Images over top or goal to help highlight certain details of Zaki and Looney. And the three Bodhisattva's on each side. Remember SOC here, Mooney is sage of the soccer tribe or the Buddha, the historical Buddha. You can see around him some of these guardians and other Bodhisattva figures. And each of the faces has one of the three mean. Bodhisattva, bodhisattva of wisdom, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, and the Bodhisattva of practice. You can see more angels on top, more beautiful scrolling vegetal designs, et cetera. And again, this stands in contrast to the box that just came before, which was completely blank. Moving into these boxes we get a completely gilded but with the silver base box with a very particular form of one of the bodhisattva. Bodhisattva Guanyin, called on in Japanese or Avila ketones Farah in Sanskrit. And this particular form here is the wish granting or wish fulfilling form. On the front face here, shown with a variety of different angelic figures around it and a little altar in front. And then after that wish fulfilling forum of the bodhisattva Guanyin, you get a variety of bejeweled boxes without much figural representation. You get these lotus flowers with pearls and other precious metals. In that you get a box made out of stone, out of marble with other precious metals and pearls around it. And little ducks here on the left and right the latch for the lock. And then at the very end, you get a little go then temple roof, a little door. And inside of it is the object that's at the very center of all of these boxes, the so called Buddhas finger bone. But I'm drawing your attention to the fact that it's a so-called finger bone because the actual object itself can't possibly be. A finger bone, is about half inches long, which would make it an extremely, extremely long finger. First off, if you look at your own finger bones, your longest bond might be around, around an inch. If you're, if you're lacking the are not lucky if you have big fingers. I guess. The other aspects it alerted to the fact that this is not actually a piece of bone as artifacts that, that's hollow. Preview who remember your basic biology and anatomy? Some bones are hollow. You're on his hollow and it's filled with marrow, which helps you to produce red blood cells. But your finger bones are not, your smaller bones don't perform that function and are not how they're solid all the way through for the most part. And so without finger bone like this isn't biologically possible. For another thing, what's more the surface as much shinier and more polished than bone gets. But usually you get pockmarked right? With the various cells of growth for the bone kind of texture. And this is actually white Jade. And that's what, again, you should sort of let yourself another way you can let yourself too. In fact, this is not for the Buddhists finger bone, is that the material itself is bone-like, but it's, it's pure stone, it's Jade. And then within it you get these little dots, which are a constellation, the Big Dipper and barely kind of make it out here. And so the Buddhist finger bone, the thing at the center of this reliquary that purports to be a part of the body of the actual Buddha is actually an illusion with its little constellation in the center. And this relates to ideas about embodiment and about how important your body is in Buddhism. And the idea that the body of the Buddha is actually not the Buddhists physical form. These are not things to necessarily the worshiped. In. In fact, all material things including our body are empty vessels, empty, empty frame. Remember, sort of tenants of Buddhism are about overcoming your attachment to the physical world and COO, including the attachments to the needs and pleasures of your own body. And part of the idea here with the constellation on the inside is the idea that the largest kind of most cosmic thing you can imagine in the ninth century red stars, the celestial all kind of sphere is MP Ed in the small part body of the Buddha within the middle of a, of a, inside of a, of a finger bone. And sort of reflecting the interconnectivity of the worlds with our own bodies. Said, nature is manifested in the most cosmic places and in the smallest pieces of, of our body. And so again, looking at that object built around the Buddha's finger bone kinda affects similarly or semi lack from of the Buddhist finger bone. We're getting a little less than about attachment to the physical world. And so that's how this whole thing is structured, right? A series of interconnected boxes, each with a kind of visual phase that we move through of guardians, a blanks, a blank section. The Buddha himself with the Bodhisattva's and then the wish fulfilling form of Guan Yin are and all the way at the center, the suppose it bone of the original Bhutto which people warships as if it were the Buddha. And the interconnected nature of these boxes creates a sequencing, right? Correct. Structures your spirit of the object. We relate this particular kind of structuring almost an architectural structure and to a tool that was used in certain kinds of Buddhism called esoteric Buddhism. Esoteric Buddhist practices developed in around the sixth century in Central Asia and in China first. And they often involve very, very complicated rituals and kinds of image worship, including the Mondelez. Mondelez could be two-dimensional or three-dimensional, as the case with this rather query, where you have a sort of geometric arrangement of deity is all around. A central deity. Visualizes certain kinds of religious relationships and cosmic worlds. And the practitioner's approach to that center deity, to having a kind of relationship with that central deity involves moving through the various stages of the Mandela, visualizing each of the kind of elements until you reach the center. And so a model is a kind of visual structure to liturgical or religious ritual or practice. And it's built around the iconography of Buddhism, which becomes very complicated, very quickly. Dependent sector in depending on what regional variation you have. Certain kinds of forms, as we talked about last time, tended to migrate across regions and sex. How is the Buddha represented, Howard, certain Bodhisattva's represented, et cetera. When you interacted with the Mandela, you identified the figures through the repeated kinds of features that the hat, they're iconography, which often had symbolic meanings. And we talked a little bit about this last class with lotus blossom, symbolizing overcoming the sort of grit and disgusting ness of the physical world. And again, all of this fits within this one particular branch of Buddhist practice called esoteric prac. And that's what we're really going to situate this set of boxes in. And one of the reasons why we can do that is because of our little clue that we talked about before. Not only the fact that these are kind of structured around is intersecting set of geometric and architectural elements, right? These boxes that interface with each other. But also of the strange sort of, again, clue that the viewer gets moving through this particular box. What's happened here with this completely silver box? While some scholars have argued that this reliquary, which is structured like a Mandela for esoteric Buddhist practice. Is it in relation to a very specific esoteric practice called the yoga practice for the Wish fulfilling form of Guanyin Bodhisattva. Remember that this box here has exactly that put us off on the wish fulfilling form by noon. And within this particular esoteric practice. A complicated set of rituals that take a lot of time to perform and hasn't stages to its structures, your engagement with this particular deity, the wish fulfilling form of Guan Yin. You use empowered position at 1 to imagine around yourself as the practitioner a flaming Adam and time wall. That is a flaming wall of metal that can't be penetrated. And into that wall of metal that is a flame. A can't be penetrated by buddy else. The bodhisattva as able to interact with the practitioner. The transforms the space through again, empowered visualization, into a kind of sacred space in which the Buddha, the Bodhisattva, Guanyin can interact with the practitioner. That's one interpretation of this silver box as that kind of reflective and therefore flaming light bounces off of it. Impenetrable metal wall in which you get a kind of protecting of the religious space so that you can have an interaction with the wish fulfilling form of Guanyin Bodhisattva. And so in that way, we can think about this whole object as part of esoteric Buddhist practice, as structured like a Mandela. And in that sense, it tells you are guides you through a particular religious practice that gets you closer to the specific wish for filling form of Guan Yin Bodhisattva. Now, questions about that before we move on to our kind of group exercise, we're gonna look at this chat box. Yes, Maggie asked about the smaller boxes. Yes. Each one is put into the bigger box before it, like nesting dolls. Descriptions of box 23. There. They don't have figures on them. They just have images of flowers and animals with precious jewels on them. And just as Daria predicted, and as we discussed, there is a kind of progression of events here that the boxes structure is about particular religious practice. In this case, it's been hypothesized that this is about one particular practice to get you closer to Guanyin Bodhisattva? Yeah, there are a variety of different tools now at this point into card things like j, this is a much more advanced technological phase or moment. So I want to actually move you to your reading. So given all that information I've given you about the kind of popularity of Buddhism, about the richness of Buddhist practice and about these esoteric practices which involve these highly engaged rituals. And the objects that help us support that, such as these precious jewels around relic. Rela query is around the boxes that protect relics. I want you to consider all of that information in relationship to the reading you had for today, which is an actual historical document written by a government official, Han Yu, to the emperor in 89 team called Memorial on the bone of the Buddha. So first ask yourself, what kind of a document is this? Then what does han you think of Buddhism and try and name specific quotes were Han Yu's talking buddhism and what he thinks of it. And what is he recommending that the emperor does? When you have those answer is popped them into the chat window. And we'll discuss them as a group. Okay? Mm-hm. S. Mm-hm. I think we've got quite a lot of good comments here. And you readings are all 100% on the money. Han Yu was not a fan of Buddhism. And as many of your comments bring out, their particular reasons why he's not a fan of. Buddhism. So first, just thinking about kind of what kind of a document this is. This is a memorial to the emperor on the bone of the Buddha. And that's exactly as you guys describe what kind of advice or a letter to persuade the emperor. As many put a persuasive kind of an act. And as Daria and brackets and put it sort of an advice, a piece of advice. And has diarrhea put it right? This there's an angle in which this seems very personal to Han Yu. And this is actually an official court document and the sort of thing that got recorded and had to be in a very particular kind of language and structure and the emotional kind of personal aspect that Han Yu puts it is very fascinating because it talks about his own particular feelings about this. And we might ask ourselves sort of what that has to do with CT policy, what a particular official might think. But it's an impassioned effort to persuade the Emperor to not allow the Buddhists finger bone reliquary into the court. As he says, at one point. Let's see let's see where's that detail? Anyway, the whole thing. Sort of that the fact that the Emperor that's going to allow the Buddha's finger bone route query to be brought ceremoniously by a group of monks to the royal court. And Han Yu thinks this is a terrible idea. And as many of you said, it cause Buddhism a cult. And that was a word that many of you repeated from the reading. And it's good that you focus on the reading to use their exact vocabulary. A cult of the barbarian peoples, as the first line says. And that idea that there, that this is a barbaric culture that is outside of the Chinese tradition, is one that many of you picked up, bond, Zach and coltan, and Matt all describes how this word barbaric is focus on. And what that means is not being part of Chinese culture, being outside of it. You can have an advanced but that exists outside of China. But the idea that it is, it is foreign and therefore barbaric kind of our culture was one of the key points in this memorial. And part of that is the fact that the Buddha didn't even speak Chinese, right? This is one of his talking points. And one of the things that honey who's afraid of is that it will corrupt our old ways. As Han Yu puts it, NSK Libre. It's about the OG kings of China. And that is a distinctly modern way to describe exactly what is going on. This is a kind of back to your roots, traditional. That is rooted in xenophobia as well. That is a fear of things that are foreign. And the idea that Buddhism or possibly be valid to China because it is a foreign religion, is central to Han years kind of rallying cry. His impassioned effort to persuade the emperor not even recognize the validity of this object as it's brought to court. And in the language of Han Yu's document and we get a lot of interesting details from the top of free 73. He describes the ways in which people are motivated through practices of Buddhism to do terrible things to their own bodies, such as singing their heads, that was lighting the hair on fire, scorching there think bares, binding together in groups of 1000 and throwing away the common close scattering that money. And he says it is not checked and the bone is, if from one temple to another in this reliquary, right? There will be those who will cut off their arms if mutilate their reflect according to the Buddha, then our old ways will be corrupted. And that was the quote that Matt pulled. Our customs violated and the tail will spread to make the mockery of the world. And this is no trifling matter. So wrapped up in this is the mutilation of the met. Certain very devout Buddhist practitioners got about two doing. And that is related to ideas of relic, right? The idea that the Buddhist finger bone as a part of the Buddha's body, might drive a practitioner to mutilate their own body as a demonstration of their non-attachment to their physical form. But high-need goes on in that last paragraph on 373 to say that the Buddha was a man of barbarians who did not speak the language of China. And he workflows of different fashion which many of you pulled. And his sayings did not concern the ways of our ancient kings, or as Caleb puts it, The O'Jays noted his manner of dress conform to their laws. He understood neither the duties that bond, sovereign and subject as mini Paul for that quote, nor the affections and father and son. And what he's getting at here is Confucianism. The idea of a kind of hierarchy that's owed where respect his own sort of up and down the ladder and everybody knows their place in a kind of moral and ethical system, such as the relationship between a father and son or between the sovereign and the subject and the Buddha. The Buddha's ideas basically throw anarchy to that kind of hierarchy that break up the stability of that Confucian system. This is something that Han Yu can't abide. He can't stand any couches as reaction to it in a kind of anti-foreigner xenophobic reaction. And as he moves to the end, as I think Evan said, the sort of skepticism takes on even sarcastic tone, right? He writes, Should the Buddha indeed have supernatural powers and descend down curses and calamities? May they fall upon the person of your servant alone who calls upon high having a witness. But he does not regret his words. So he's saying, he's be basically again sarcastically saying, if the Buddha actually has these superpowers to cause those kind of havoc, then I take responsive full responsibility for the blast for me that just happen here. But he obviously in that case, and he wants to return to Confucianism and that's what he's advocating for. And Han Yu's advocation for a kind of return to Confucian values wasn't the face of, again, a Buddhist church that was swollen with wealth. In a period where the Tang Empire was beginning to disintegrate already. And in a period where the Buddhist church was getting more and more practitioners in the period of the Tang dynasty. And this particular document has often signaled the beginning of a kind of reaction against Buddhism, a nativist reaction against the foreign religion as Han you put it, of Buddhism and its width. These ideas that are sort of new Confucianism, Neo-Confucianism begins to develop in the late Tang and then takes root in the following Song Dynasty. And again, there's a nativist rationale here. Buddhism is a cult of barbarians, people outside of China. And again, as, as I mentioned in the earlier slide, there's a moment of religious persecution when the Tang Dynasty government seizes the AF assets, confiscates the wealth of these temples, and tries to expel foreign religions from practicing by shutting down 40,010 balls and 4 thousand monasteries. Which is again root in nativist reaction has seen a phobic politics as well as an economic disintegration. And so that caps off what we're going to say and talk about with his wounds fingerboard Rather query. And I want to turn our attention to a kind of extension of these ideas of Neo-Confucianism into the next dynasty. But just to sort of cap off the tongue. Oh, right. I forgot that slide was here. So again, Neo-Confucianism begin to develop with the rack I can use in the ninth century against, against Buddhism and advocates instead of return to nativist ideas of Confucianism, right? And remember that Confucianism is an ethical philosophy. It's focused primarily on human relationships include relationships with ancestors, dead, but largely he's sort of in, in living. Whereas Buddhism is about these grand metaphysical ideas of transcending the body. It's based on the ideas of Confucius. But as we discussed earlier, during the Han dynasty, Han Confucianism wasn't just about the words of Confucius. It was a variety or documents that became adopted as part of the political philosophy of state. And it's sort of original Confucianism. Neo-confucianism is different blight called New or Neo-Confucianism. It's a revival of those ideas, right, of return to the past. But it's mixed with new ideas at this point, including some of these metaphysical ideas that come exactly from the religions that are being criticize such as Buddhism and awesome. And the trend toward a revival of Confucianism mixed with some of these larger metaphysical ideas begins when people like Han Yu, but really takes root in the Song Dynasty. And the Song rulers try to envision themselves as people who are about re-establishing the Ancient Order of the Han. One of the concepts that becomes really kind of crucial to this and mutual encounter in the next class is an example of one of these or fit metaphysical i, as it comes into play with Confucianism, wasn't really part of original Confucianism. And that is the idea of principle or the idea that there is, there are principles that you've been identified to the way in which the universe is organized. And that through the power of human reasoning, you can figure out what those principles are. How does water flow in particular kinds of landscapes? How did the seasons create certain kinds of environments for living or the cultivation of agriculture? And different geographic as how our rocks and trees formed through natural processes. And what are the expressions that becomes popular among these philosophers have Neo-Confucianism. As Gould, you're the idea that you observe the way that the world is in order to establish its principles and nor to establish its the. And this idea again will become useful to us in the next class especially, but we'll use it here as an example again of one of these more metaphysical Ike is not part of original Confucianism. To show that Neo-Confucianism differed from old school Confucianism. Now, the transition from the end of the tongue in 908 to this splintering again of China into a variety of smaller kingdoms for about 50 years. And then it's a reunification. In this song. We're going to kind of, and so for this, again, we are getting these periods of disruption of disorganization than the reorganization under slightly different principles. The Sung Dynasty lasts on paper for over 300 years. But there's a very crucial split in the middle that divides the Northern Song from the Southern Song Dynasty. And I had to do with pressures from the northern border first through kingdoms that called themselves the shisha or the Western Xia and the Liao. And then eventually the Jin Dynasty, and then eventually the Mongolians. And we'll talk about those transitions next class and the class in which we do best. Goryeo dynasty, Korea. For now, what you need to know is that the sole reunified China again and reunified under New Confucian values, Neo-Confucianism, excuse me. And its own dynasty. Like the town was a period of great wealth and stability and richness. There are scholars, historians have argued that as early as the 11th, 12th century in the Song Dynasty, we can talk about a kind of advent of early modernism. Even certain features that they use to describe that include a kind of cosmopolitan nature of places like the capital of the Song in Kaifeng, which is supposedly shown in this painting. An excerpt from this. This is an excerpt from a painting of called up river and the Qingming Festival and by Jones are drawn from the 12th century. And it is the whole Hans row itself. You can go look up sometime is maybe the most famous painting in all of Chinese history. And what it shows is a kind of as time moves forward, move right to left in the, in the day. And that happens over the length of the hand scroll. Moving into this bustling capital or, or market economy town. And there's all these sorts of different interactions of different kinds of people happening. Really have read this hand squirrel thoroughly to think about just how developed the Song Dynasty was. Population under Chinese rule at this point is over a 100 million people. There was highly specialized agriculture, meaning that people had for profit crops would bring those to get centers where they would trade those crops for other goods and for money. And so we're already getting the establishment of a kind of market system economy in the Song Dynasty in the 12th century. There were even such things as joint stock venture, something that we generally tend to think about with the development of much later capitalist economies. And so all of this is to say that the song was an incredibly develops economic and cosmopolitan dynasty that some people have argued. Again, this is constitutes a kind of early modernism in East, East Asia. What we want to turn our attention to is the way in which buddhism takes a backseat now among the people of the tongue to a new kind of order that's based on revival of confusion about hoofs. And the Song Dynasty Court. As we hinted at just before and in the, in the Tang Dynasty, switches over entirely into a meritocracy in terms of promoting people into government ranks. You had to take a civil service examination in order to secure a rank, which was the best way to secure. I'm a job in the bureaucracy in which was the bad way to secure the wealth and stability of your family. That being said, the fact that you had to take an exam doesn't create a meritocracy. Fully. There were all sorts of biases within the system, including the fact that in order to educate a son and it was only son. So there's a sexist kind of division here or division based on gender. In order to educate your son to make it through the civil service examination, you needed to have quite a lot of resources in terms of hiring private tutors. And I'm having the time to educate that person. And so it really was the descendants of old aristocratic families that maintained position. Even in the so-called meritocracy. The song emperors were obsessed with collecting and cataloging the art of the past. One of the signs of a sort of return to Confucian values and in, and in that we associate with Neo-Confucianism. There was also an imperial painting Academy, which we'll get in next class. And they hired court painter to paint some of these sorts of Neo-Confucian ideals into images. And again, we'll get there next class. But let's move on to our last object and R ten minutes left here, which is this painting by legal mean. And how am I going to ask was how it reflects Neo-Confucian values that began with Han Yu, but then really fully developed in the Northern Song Dynasty in this meritocracy and this system by which you had to demonstrate your position, your ability to gain position at court as an official through memorizing certain kinds of Putian texts. So who was legal in he lived sort of in the, in the heart of the Northern Song Dynasty in terms of its period right at the height of Northern Song rule in the 11th and early 12th century. As I just discussed, it was really people like the woman who descended from Eric product family is large, wealthy land and families that could afford to get positions at court because they could afford to pass the imperial examinations. He passes it at a relatively young age of 29, but immediately avoids government service and retreats into the mountains where he acts as a kind of hermit for many years. Eventually he takes up a low-level position in government. Buddy is mostly concerned with avoiding government responsibility. Again, some dude who have privilege and wealth. But what it hearkens back to UX is people like soldier and won't cheat. In the Six Dynasties Period when this idea for moving yourself from politics became one way to demonstrate your morally upright behavior. Again, all basically presupposing that you have the wealth in order to support yourself. Part of the reason that he himself out of politics is because many of his friends had been caught up in politics. And we'll talk about this next class. And particularly with factual is politic at court. Factionalism is when you have two party is that basically are fighting for the sake of of doing and and conquering or I'm doing one another at EPFL policy as he looked forward to going to see now Andy, come on, come on, come on. I'm going to mute somebody air. So you had, in legal means, lifetime two factions. One was organized under a kind of group reformists headed by someone named Wang unsure. And the other were conservatives have represented older families like Sima, Guang and Su. Sure. And we'll talk about those policies a little bit next class. But it was basically all about economic reform. And this factionalism at, at the issue of how to reform the economy. In terms of the reformists and the conservatives, created a highly politicized environment. And people like legal Nin wanted to take themselves out of that. And so they remove themselves from politics and devoted themselves to painting, to poetry and other sorts. And there's a terrible spelling here. Class, all kinds of pursuits that defined them as intellectuals and helped them to define their own kind of moral position outside of the politics of CT. And with this returned to kind of classical roots that we associate with the Confucianism, came a return in the arts to classical texts and the classical visual iconography as Bo and the red that we use to describe this, especially in the Song Dynasty is literati painting. I literati arts, which we already encountered in the Six Dynasties Period. That is, art forms that make explicit reference to highly cultured sorts of references that you could only know if you had devoted your life to studying the past in terms of poetry, history, and visual culture as well. And understanding these kinds of references was important to being a literati, to showing other people how educated you were and into sharing that kind of sense of history of classicism. I think I'm out of time on this class, but I'll try and push through to the end. So one way in which new classical or Neo-Confucian values and the Northern Song are demonstrated by legal means. Painting is the subject matter of the painting, which is a particular book called The Isaac of filial piety. Confucian texts that supposedly records conversations between Confucius and one of his disciples, Xunzi. They're 18 chapters and alone. And it had been part of the kind of Canada or group of classical texts associated with Confucianism even in the Han dynasty. And it emphasizes all this work and title. Filial piety shell. So paper start to us. It's filial piety that is at the root of all virtue and that from which all moral teaching grows, our body is down to every strand of hair and bit of skin are received from our parents. There's type of traffic, I'm sorry. And we do not dare to injure or wound them. Note that in complete contrast to the kinds of things that Han Yu says about Buddhism, which is all about deforming or sacrificing parts of the body. Classical filial piety says that that is actually a kind of fundamental sin against the Confucian ideal of, of virtue. And the beginning of filial piety again is respecting the body that your parents have given you. And again, the rest of the passage goes on to talk about ancestors and cultivating your relationship to your ancestors. And that is really at the root of what this word is. Filial piety, being pious or reverential toward your ancestors, and particularly toward your existing ancestors, your parents, your grandparents. And so that kind of hierarchy that exists within the family, respect up the ladder generationally. That's what we're talking about when we talk about filial piety. And according to this text, that is the root of all virtue, all good behavior stems from that. There are many leaves in his album, some of which are in great condition, but each of them demonstrates along with the text, an aspect of filial piety, such as the way in which high ministers and great officers or interact with one another. Or the way in which princes of state, shown here and carriage and being drawn through the city relate to their subjects. And so these model relationship that are at the core of interaction within a Confucian system are being visualized here by legal Lin alongside the texts of the cloud filial piety, each of the chapters is alongside the image and the particular text that day. From the tenth chapter, or the destruction of the acts of filial piety. And it begin, the master said, which many of you have probably heard parodied as Confucius says. That is actually how many of these dialogues, as they're recorded in Confucian texts, begins Zui Or the master says, the service which is sun renders to his parents is as follows. It is general conduct toward them. He manifests the utmost reverence, is nourishing of them. He endeavors to give them the utmost pleasure when they're ill, he feels anxiety in morning them. He exhibits grief and sacrificing to them. He displays solemnity. When a sound is complete and needs five things. He's able to serve his parents and serves as parents. And high situation. That is, if you're born into a privileged position, will be free from pride. You're born into a low situation. You'll be from insubordination that is, fighting to get their superiors. And if you are among equals, you won't be quarrelsome. Because high situation pride leads to ruin. If you're in a low situation, insubordination leads to punishment. And among equals, quarrelsome ness leads to conflict, wielding of weapons. So if those three things are not put away, even though a son is everyday contributing and pork. Nurses, parents, your start acting filial. What's important to highlight here is a couple of things. First, your position in the hierarchy model by your behavior within your family, respect toward your parents. Segment. The image that legal gives us to illustrate all of these texts doesn't show any of this right? About the relationship of image 2u narrative to written narrative right? Here we have entertaining the parents in order to show them respect. In the foreground, have a magician who's got a bird flying out of a hidden kind of box. We have a little person dancing with a foreign head dress on, and two little children playing alongside them, as well as a musician. And here you have the filial son and his wife serving the parents on a pedestal food. And so this is proper display of, again, being a good filial son. One of the interesting things that happens in the chapter was about mourning for your parents, is that image shown doesn't reflect the text at all, just shows a simple landscape. This chapter, when a filial son is mourning for a pair of L's and with prolonged silence. And after three days he can finally eat a prepare an ancestral temple, et cetera, for the disembodied spirit. None of that is shown here. And in a way, what legal is doing is abstracting all of that intense emotion and passion from the text into a landscape. And this is generally understood to be a metaphorical use of landscape. Again, you can connect a little bit to our landscape images all the way back to Kou Culture and to the image would encounter next class in terms of the metaphor, metaphorical use of landscapes and to a particular classical reference to the Book of Songs member. You read the book songs dated to around 600 BCE. In one of the songs reads the two of you and often about floating, floating far away longingly, I think if you, My heart within his pained. And this is understood to be, again, a classical reference that legal name gives in this last image. And when his friend Sue sure. Ligo Lynn's friend, reads this image, looks at it. He notes this in his, in it Colophon and has an inscription of the painting. Any images, the figures to the painting of Gu caterer from You know, 800 years or in their says his brushwork is as good as Gu Cai jurors brushwork it so classicism right there. As for the final chapter in which all of a sudden the oldest son finds an bearable is described. The painter conveys these meanings in the faintest suggestion of form. None but a true superior man that isn't educated or literatus, right? Illiterate. Possessing in the way that is proper Confucian mindset could achieve this level of art or artistic creativity. And so again, Su, Sure, legal means contemporary is at this image, seeing how it's abstracted, use landscape as a metaphor. And using these old textual references from 50-100 years before to abstract the pain of morning. This is noticeable by something like sushi who recognize it, says that's really artful painting. And this is what we think of when we think of the litter, the arts in particular. Just stay with me for just a couple of minutes. I'm going to cover two last points and I'll cover this is the beginning of next class if you absolutely have to go. He says the sushi, that the figures are like a group pagers figures, that is the strong outline figures. And they tend to convey a kind of sense of who the person is through the formality of the figures are drawn with these hard outline images. Sushi in, in the 12th century. That get legal means painting and says This painting is as good as Gu Cai juices. So there's one asset aspect of classicism or a reference to the past visually. There's a classes isn't happening in the calligraphy as well. The calligraphy that is included alongside these images conveys the original text of the Classic of Filial piety is done in a very particular style of calligraphy. A style that relates to Han Dynasty clerical script. Such that the balance of the words in terms of how they're organized horizontally and vertically. And the weight positioning of the brush in certain areas is supposed to look like. And this is supposed to draw your attention to Han Dynasty calligraphy and particularly classical clerical calligraphy. N2 therefore, situate this 12th century image with its calligraphy in its use of references that date all the way back to the hand Misty, the height of Neo-Confucianism. And you can see again that kind of balance of these words as compared to she has calligraphy of long, she jerks calligraphy over here where everything sort of tilts up and you get the tip of the point sort of shown and the brushes hitting down. Whereas clerical script is much more symmetrically. Balance left to right doesn't tip up at the side. It tends to kind of favor weighted balance of the characters even down into the bottleneck with this character here, Quan or chin, I'm sorry. So the outline here, and I'll go to the beginning of next class if any of you have had to kinda jet ready. Legal Lin's painting reflects these Neo-Confucian values by illustrating a Confucian texts right off the bat that the texts that has being illustrated here is an old Confucian text. But there's also this aspect of the visual reference happened in calligraphy and in the style of painting that people like Sue, Sure, we go, Lynn's friend could see and recognize that the figures reference Cu Chi jurors paint. Or if the calligraphy references this golden age of Han Dynasty calligraphy in which Confucianism was at its height. We can also think of who'll legal Nin once right? As someone who served briefly the Song Dynasty Confucian court with all of its complicated Neo-Confucian values and it's meritocracy, right? You have to take this exam system to move forward. As well as the way in which he's using landscape as a metaphor for this kind of human condition as a way of thinking about how this sort of abstract ideas of Neo-Confucianism are reflected in the abstraction. A landscape of distilling the landscapes to these kinds of principles up form and of behavior as well. So we'll go over this, the beginning of next class because I had at the end. But it will help to get us to segue into the content of next class as well. Thanks for bearing with me. I hope you guys all have a good day. Let me see if there's any other issues here in the chat window. And continue at the moment, so I'll let you all go. Have a good afternoon. Thank you. Thanks.



## [07. Imperial Art and Literati Art in China](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/07-imperial-art-and-literati-art-in-china?module_item_id=2446435)
 Oh, alright, let's go ahead and get started. A quick reminder. For those of you who may have let it slip. Your first written assignment is due today, and there is no one week grace period, it's due today, so please get it done so that I can grade them and so that you can move on to the second aspect of that, which is to respond do appear response to one another's writing. Are there any questions about that before we go onto today's class? Ok. Today's class then. So we have three objects to get through today, which means it'll jam-packed. And we're focusing on both the production of art for the court during the Song Dynasty in China, and also the production of art outside of the court, which often related to politics. And so are three central questions are about landscape painting. And that's what we're going to focus on this painting backwash sheet. Under the Song Dynasty Emperor Shen zone. We're going to talk about Emperor white zone, who served later in the Song dynasty and who painted this image over here on the far right. And we're going to talk about art outside of the court and literati art in relation to this painting by when tone. So first let's start with some visual analysis and using your chat window. I want you to respond to these prompts. You can look at the as it is on the screen, or you can open the painting from the canvas files. It's a much larger file. And through this painting by Guo Xi, when we look at this in person in class, i have of reproduction that's almost to scale. This is a very large painting. It's the size of a wall essentially. And so you have to imagine higher supposed to interact with it in those terms as if you're walking up to it and looking at it. It's the size of an actual person, this painting. So keeping that in mind. In the chat window, I have how you naturally gravitate toward wandering through the painting, imagining yourself in the painting, what path does your I take? And then also in the chat window, try and find two excerpts from the text I gave you today, which is by this paint and his son, that describe how you're supposed to engage with landscape painting. So take some time and do that, and then we'll bring it to a larger group discussion ones, I have enough chat problems. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah. Whoops. Okay. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Well, let's go ahead and get started. So interesting if you guys were following your own sort of flow of ideas as a class rather than just your own posting, is that many of you started in different places, right? They didn't necessarily one exact place to start their multiple entry points to this landscape. The majority of you, however, started from the bottom and moved upward to the top as if you were climbing the mountain. And I got those notes from MR. Caleb, Lucas, Christina, Ethan. Some of you mentioned specifically why you gravitate toward the bottom and part of it. And one thing that many of you said was that the contrast is greater than that. There's more of a heavy detailing of a landscape aspects. And so your eye gravitates there because you're looking at all those details because the forums seem more solid. Others of you grab it toward the middle. I think I had Tyler, who had said the negative space actually attracts his attention the most. And then Eric started from the top, then move down almost as if you were following the watershed of the mountain, right? Of the cloud is dense and turn to water as you end up at the bottom. What is difficult to sort of see in this image unless you've zoomed in on it. Or if we're in person, we will be looking at this very nice reproduction in person is that there are actually lots of little moments in the landscape where you see human elements, even though this is a massive landscape scene from a kind of elevated purse div, there are many elements of human interaction in the landscape that also help to Troy you through the landscape. And one of the last comments thereby, Ethan talked about how when you look at a landscape, you think about rambling through it and stop at the contemplate in various places, the landscape and some of the details which if you, again, if you zoom in on it, you might be able to see on the left side there's actually a scholar. You can tell that by his hat here on a donkey and a servant here carrying some of the other goods, walking along a bridge through this receding water where that goes off into the far left of the paintings, about halfway up the painting on the left side, at the very bottom, there's a group of, on both, on both sides of the central landscapes section. There are figures getting out of boats at the shore of some sort of lake or river or unsure really from the perspective that we have. And then up on the right hand side of the painting, halfway through their group of multistoried buildings and a little pavilion where you could even contemplate as Eric pulled out of Cuo Shi in courses description, you can even sort of sit imaginatively in this little pavilion open to the air on these little stools that are left open and contemplate the landscape around you. So you move through the landscape and as Guo Sheng Guo, So right, the figures on the, on the mountains mark out the pathways for your eyes as well. And high buildings. Buildings with more than one story that are set up high in the mountains help to also give it the sense of a kind of lofty, almost religious or sacred place. And I do recommend zooming in on the image when you get a chance in Canvas opening it up and wandering through the various elements of it. And so the landscape in general, just as you all pointed out, kind of space for wandering. And you can begin at various places in the human figures. Help you to do that to some degree, but so does the method of constructing the landscape in terms of its general composition and in terms of the kind of negative space to positive space, in terms of the contrast being greatest at the bottom and then disappearing as you move up to the top. And this is something a couple of you talked about, unrelated to the fact that this is a spring landscape. And several of you talked about seasonal aspect, which is really good. That's close reading of this because this text doesn't talk just about spring. It talks about all the other elements as well. But the fact that you related that to the title of this painting, early spring, is it is important. And so as several of you said, Gabby, you talked about how the smiling landscape in spring is, is, is, is if smiling, seductive as if smiling. And this is about partway down page 47. And I'll just read that whole paragraph. The second full paragraph, missed around mountains is not the same in at the Four Seasons, mountains of spring are light and. As if smiling. Mountains of summer have a blue-green color, which seems to be dropping all over. And the mountains of autumn or bright and clean as if embellished by rouge or cosmetics is if a painted, a woman's painted faces is the metaphor here. In the mountains of winter are sad and tranquil as if sleeping. And if exact pulled out that, that quote. And again, this is early spring, right? It's owed you getting this transition between winter where everything appears to be DAD, right? Growth is in hibernation, et cetera. And Spring where the landscape is just coming to life again. And that aspect, the seasonal aspect is important not only to this painting, but also to in general landscape painting of this time. The fact that the seasons have metaphorical relationships to how you're supposed to kind of think about, about the image. Whether this is a moment of growth and prosperity are one of a kind of recession or loneliness or routineness, right? Other aspects again about concerning that kind of diffusion, right, of the clouds. I think Ethan talked about this. That the clouds are at Downey and diffused and the people are happy in contemplation of such pictures. Because such pictures, contemplating them evokes corresponding ideas and men corresponding reactions of the heart. And here's yet another example of the way in which you're supposed to look at this and have a mood. And the mood is constructed for you by the artists and by the associations with the seasons. But again, if we're just focusing on kind of the technical aspects, it was interesting that Ethan noted this diffusion rate that we call atmospheric recession. It's one way of demonstrating to the audience depth in painting. So if we just think about how the image is constructed as a landscape, the horizon line, that is where the world seems to disappear in the background, is set about two-thirds of the way up the painting. But behind the central, central peak current, we have this foreground in which trees like this are larger there made larger so that we think about them as being closer. Whereas the same basic kind of tree, this old knotty pine, halfway up the landscape here. We can tell but forms a language of lions, right? Is much smaller. And so we think about this is further away from us. But the atmospheric recession, the clouds does that too, which is part of why many of you gravitated toward the more detailed, less cloudy aspects up front. And then moved into the kind of missed where things become a little bit less clear. And then as you get way far back toward the horizon back here, you can barely make out the forms of mountains with a little wash over them. And again, atmospheric recession is something that you see. Cross r. Periods, it is a way to kind of demonstrate depth. And if you're outside on a hazy day, you see how that works as well. The moisture and other elements in the atmosphere prevents the light from, from bouncing off of everything and you cannot see clearly and very far. Instead, you have a kind of reduced distance of vision because of the atmosphere. Um, a couple of other elements that came out of this description that are important to mention. You guys talked about the correlation of sky and are fed Mindy and air, kind of pulling that quote out. And again, you get that balance here in the image. And this is important too. Landscape painting setting, that's kind of horizon line, the sky and the ground. And balancing the correlation between sky and Earth. Not only just in terms of how you're looking at the image, but also in terms of how detailed you make the image. If you look at this painting, about half of it is painted, the other half is left almost entirely blank. What's happening there is that you're reading B's negative spaces where there's no painting as Miss task out. And you're reading this negative space down here with just a few little washes to cut across it as water. But an actuality that, that's, that's unpainted silk. This is a painting on silk in one color. For the most part, there's a little bit of color in the buildings, but for the most part, it's just Inc. It's mono chromatic. As we say, at that idea of painting, substance painting thing that you can see. And then using the voice of the silk left unpainted to give you a kind of balance of positive and negative space is central to the way in which these sorts of paintings look. You're left to imagine through the suggestion of the painted forms. What's happening in the negative spaces, unpainted spaces of the painting. And that makes it kind of painting very different than oil painting, which is an additive process where you build up and you usually build up from dark to light. Yeah, that's right. Dark to light in an oil painting. Whereas in this painting, the olden reverse, you start off with a very light ink sketch. And then you slowly begin to accumulate more ink and the very last places to be painted in Chinese painting and in East Asian painting in general, are the darkest places that way you have the ability to kind of adjust. Because if you're leaving this negative space, right? If you make a mistake in your darkest stink, it becomes difficult to change, right? Whereas if you building from light to dark and you make a little mistake and kind of lighting can always compensate for that as you build toward the dark. So the process we have to think of as kind of inverted from a Western process of stacking oil paint on top of oil paint and on top of a canvas. This is all absorbed into the silk. And you work in, in reverse. One aspect that is interesting to focus on are two aspects and interesting to focus on. Diana, I think, pulled us into this discussion with the fact that coarse machine Guo. So say at the bottom of page 46 that if you're going to learn to paint landscapes, you should, you yourself go into the landscape and contemplate them that he should study the way the natural world looks. Otherwise, your painting is not going to look like the natural world. And as we'll discuss in a minute, that correlates to one of the principal ideas that's on your vocabulary list and that we discussed last class. That's central to Neo-Confucianism in general. That is, principles, the principles of the things around you. What does the principle of the landscape in spring or in winter, et cetera. Another quote that I pulled up here that I didn't see yet in the chat. But it might have come as I've been discussing things is the section where Guassian Guo, so right about how it is you relate the mountains to one another. And he writes, a great mountain is dominating the cheap over the assembled kills. Thereby ranking in an ordered arrangement of ridges and peaks and valleys as suzerainty of varying degree and distances. A suzerainty as a lesser official. The general appearance is of a great lord, glorious on His throne, that's the highest peak. And princes hastening to pay him court without any arrogance or withdrawal. And again, you might think of what we talked about last class with legal Lin's description of how to be a filial person in a New Confucian order, right? How to relate to those in power? If you are a person without power, or how to relate to others among equal. Here we're getting a very explicit description. And the metaphor, the landscape is like a completely ordered Confucian society with the, with the lord or the emperor at the top. And then dissenting from there the barriers people of different orders. And that maps out in the kind of way in which the landscape at human elements as well. You'll see here there's multi-story tower denotes that this is an important building, probably a temple of some sort. Remember here is where you have the scholar write a kind of official that serves the Lord as he's moving up into this landscape. And at the very bottom you have more common people, fishermen, people who sustain the kind of stability of the economy and of the whole system. Other quotes thick it all out. We just talked about, about this, about the idea of going yourself out and looking at the landscape. And one of you, I think I don't have the name now. I'm sorry, I can't give you lip service here, but whenever you pulled out this idea of using the ink, I think it was Maggie and and had not having the ink use you. And that is an interesting way to talk about the engagement of the painters body in the process of making an artwork. The fact that it's of energetic engaged sort process. That as washing was a say, is like calligraphy, which is another quote I pulled from the reading. The difficulty of handling brush and ink in the landscape is the same as in painting the landscape, it's the same as an RFI. And so you can think about the same kinds of bodily gestures that are evoked in texts like Lady ways, battle formation of the brush, which we read about in our Six Dynasties Period in China in relation to calligraphy, the idea that you follow the various brushstrokes, the calligraphy to think with the person who made it. You see that corresponding to painting as well here. That you read this, like you might read calligraphy. And that's one of the reasons why painting, this is going monochromatic. It us closer to the art of writing, the art of calligraphy, and the gestures and structures of building this landscape can be deconstructed by anybody who had some knowledge of Prussia Inc., which is anybody who is literate. So that's our kind of visual analysis of this painting. And we're correlating what we see in the image to exactly what it is that the people who painted the image, I want you to think about as you're moving through the image. And what's amazing there I think is that even a 1000 years later, many of you needed with the image just has Guo Cheng course, I wanted you to. The image helps to do that for you, right? It's constructed in a way that tells you how to engage with it. But the text tells us a little bit more about at this time what it was that people were thinking about when they constructed landscape images like this. It's not just an image of some pretty outdoor place. Is a multi-layered political at sort of problems, propagandistic group of messages about Neo-Confucianism and about the way in which paintings like this serve the court, which we'll go into in just a minute. So just looking over the C, There's one question. Caleb, when was Corso from? So Corso was guo Xi's son. And he's not particularly important to the story except for the fact that the writing that we have here is by Cauchy and his son corsa. And so you have to remember that the, the writings by both of them, and it was probably penned after gosh is death by his son as a way of kind of sustaining the lineage of painting by relating courses painting to cause she's painting because Guo She was a more important painter historically. Which two? In just a minute. So just to remind you, the Song dynasty reunify China after the end of the Tang when it's broken up for about 50 years or so. And the Song Dynasty has an Northern and Southern period. The people, the song just thought of themselves as, as the song over both of those periods. And that's because you have quite a lot of pressure from the north in terms of these other non-Chinese dynasties. Putting military pressure on that northern boundary. And to images that were starting within this class quot she's painting and the tone painting of bamboo are happening when the Song Dynasty is still in possession of its northern territories. And we'll talk about at the very end, the break that happens, that in which the Song dynasty loses those northern territories. At this time in general, a painting, my core, she's early spring, can be seen in context of a growth of the interest in landscape painting in general. Whereas an earlier dynasties really was portraiture and figure painting that dominated, that was considered the most and style of painting. Sometime in Five Dynasties period into the beginning of the Song Dynasty, landscape becomes the most popular. The size of the painting increases. This idea of monumental landscapes. Again, I wish we had been in person and so I could show you this reproduction. It's the size of most of your body's. You walk up to this and step into it, encountering it as you would a person in space almost. And each of these landscapes are another example of the kind of monumental landscape painting of this time is of that size, which is why we give it this name, the monumental landscape. And one thing we draw from that is that these are for public display. So unlike hand scrolls, which are very personal and right, you can only really view them a few people at a time, right? Because one person has to be in charge of unrolling and rolling it. Hanging scroll like bees and landscape paintings are meant to be seen in a kind of public space, therefore display and therefore the kind of messages they convey our bout. Public sorts of ideas. Landscape painting, when translated from the original Chinese, literally just means the painting of mountains and waters. And in that you get this correlation of the earth and the heavens as discussed or arm. And non form negative space, which is often water or cloud. And the concrete space of depicted forms in rocks and trees, on mountains, etc. So if we start to build a little bit more information around who she was and how this particular painting, early spring serves the Emperor. There are a few details that become important. Or she was not just painting things on his own in his own studio. He was employed by the imperial court, by the emperor. In the new imperial painting Academy. The court of Emperor Shun zone in the late part of the 11th century in Song Dynasty and had a whole subset of of the court that was a painting Academy that produced images. The use of the court. And that's the context in which this landscape painting is made. Room for some of our background information here, right? We're in a new Confucian order and I think now is based on a so-called meritocracy. That is, your advancement at court is based on your merit, how you prove yourself. And at the top of that hierarchy, of course, that Confucian hierarchy is the M or the person who is painting this relationship between that happens in the earth and who is, has the duty to be the most morally responsible, virtuous person. Remember we talk class about the interest in these, in this re emphasis on Confucianism in cataloging and collecting the art of the past as well. And that's one thing the emperor Shenzhou did as well as his grandson, I believe emperor Quaid XOM, who will talk about in a minute. And so art, the art of the past and the present was very important to conveying of Confucian order. And you can see that in the, the texts that we read where Cauchy and Gua, so talk about how great mountain is like a Chief over the hills. And that the general appearance of a landscape as of a great lord, the peak in the center. And all of the other different people who serve him around him in a kind of peaceful, organized manner. And that's the kind of message that's being conveyed in these large monumental landscape paintings. There models for B order of, of, of the Song Dynasty. So some of the ideas that we want to pull in here, again, you've already dealt with to some degree, right? And these first several here are from last class. You should have notes on them already. But again, you can always go back and look at these if I move quickly through this slide, we have to think of this in terms of the revival of Confucian ideals that with Neo-Confucianism. And the idea that you now have some of these metaphysical ideas about the world around you being involved in Confucianism. Ideas like, Excuse me, what is the principle and a given thing? What does the principle of a landscape? And during the Song Dynasty, these ideas became philosophically and politically important as The Song Dynasty established itself in relationship especially to Han Dynasty Confucianism. But now mixed with these are again philosophical ideas that come from Taoism and Buddhism. And those ideas can be seen in a text like Cauchy and Gua says, which is about going out into the mountains and streams and contemplating them, contemplating their principles, right? One of the core ideas in, in Neo-Confucian metaphysical thinking and the idea again of our merit. C, right. Each of these peaks serving the center peak supporting it in a way, in a proper Confucian order. Now, this painting was made at a specific time in the court politics. When there were proposals being put forward by someone named Wang non-shared. Who high court ministers are these little peak surrounding the center peak we could think of it of. And in many ways this painting has been seen as propaganda specifically for the set of new reforms put forward by Wang. Unsure. And again, if we think about the way in which Cauchy and courses landscape is supposed to create a correlating group of ideas in viewers that relate to the mood of the landscape. What is the mood of landscape? As you've just told me, it is about coming out of spring, right? That sense of being happy, that sense of a kind of moving or shuffling off of the constraints of the winter, right? Something that is moving toward the seductive and smiling and light, airy nature of spring. And in that sense, the, they relate again to these reforms put forward by the court Minister Wang unsure. So who was long on shear. Under Chun Zong, He actually became the Prime Minister, the foremost GF official. And he was favored by and Persian zone. One of the reasons why Wang on chars life ends when Emperor Shun zone it's life, it is that they had a kind of relationship of ministry to ruler that was, that was quite close. And when Shen Zong dies, while ensures is is put out of court and he and he dies a year later. His policies, his new reforms to so-called new reforms, were about economic growth. And they were in s. And the most fundamental, basic way of thinking of it was they were designed to tax scholars and to tax people who have more wealth. And therefore to ease the burden on the people at the base of the economy, the farmers, et cetera, the conservative factions by people sue sure. Who will get to in a minute. But who came up last class in relationship to legal Lin's painting, they were friends where old, often aristocratic families who did not want to give up their power base of land or wealth. In order to fund this new tax reform put forward by Prime Minister Wang, unsure. And these two sides, these two major factions at court. But it ends with one another and basically divided the courts in half. And the way we can think of that division, that factionalism, as being produced in part by this meritocracy. Because in the mare talk RSI, right? You have people who are moving up based on their intelligence. So we're getting much more. Structured an intense debate at court. You will also have the potential, and it happened sometimes, although more rarely, the potential for someone to move up in terms of their class system, right? To move up into the scholarly, landed gentry class through their performance intellectually. Whereas before you had to come more or less from an aristocratic family in order to gain a position at court. So there's Neo-Confucian balancing. One, being able to gain a position at court by performing their intelligence on the civil service examinations lead in many ways to factionalism at sea. In the reformers. Is Av1 unsure? When Wang richer had the emperor's ear, his opposition in someone like sushi was banished from court. Sushi was forced to serve in two distinct periods of his life away from CT in the sort of exile, far-out reaches of the Empire to be a minister somewhere where it didn't matter to serve in Guam for instance, and, and, and kind of American mindset. And so what this also gives rise to is getting of what we might call a kind of literati art practice which about performing your moral nature. Especially when you are cast out of court, when you are in exile. And that comes all the way back to this idea of what it means to be a gentleman, what it means to be a kind of educated person in China that we discussed with that idea of self-cultivation back in the Six Dynasties Period. And so again, our painting here is often considered as an image to support, as visual propaganda because she's painting for impressions on to support the ideas of Wang unsure these reformers policies creating new economic growth by taxing of the upper classes more. And that idea of moving from winter to spring is seen as a metaphor, just as the painting text tells us of, of growth, right? And that creates a corresponding idea and viewers of the pleasures of the coming of spring. So moving on from S0 to our other images, again, we've just discussed the ways in their set of Neo-Confucian values in this otherwise been a beautiful landscape painting, right? We might think about this is purely an aesthetic or pleasurable, but it served Neo-Confucian ideals and a variety of ways that we just talked about in last class. I had to rush through to the end, but I'm going to kind of re imbedded into this class. So these, these classes are connected. We talked about the way in which Neo-Confucian values were portrayed in figure painting. So we're getting different kinds of images constructed to convey a sense of what proper New Confucian behavior is. And as we discussed last class and this is a kind of condensed slide from last class. You may have to go back and look at this. And our question was, how does legal Lin's painting reflect these new Confucian values? During the Song Dynasty Court. Remember that it's illustrating from the beginning of Neo-Confucian tech strength. Whereas in the landscape painting, right, you're, you're not getting a text illustrated. You are getting the construction of a landscape as a kind of a metaphor for the Empire. And you also get within that kind of imbedded group of references to classical texts, other kinds of illusions, that soft illusion, it's allusion, right, a reference to something else. And this is something we also connect to the literati arts and we're building toward the next object in today's class. So remember there are these classical references that happen in the figure painting and in the calligraphy. Calligraphy hearkens back to P of a 1000 years before, used in the golden age of Han Dynasty Confucianism, the clerical script that was found even 1000 years later, carved into old steel Is that had been made and say the second century like this. So that's the style of calligraphy that legal Nian used. And there's also these references that happen in the painting. And this is where our buddies to share comes into play. Remember sushi wrote on legal Nunes hand scroll. And he wrote things like this. Fantastic brushwork is not at all inferior to qu Kaiser's right, this famous painter of the past. And so part of literati aesthetics, part of literati painting is making a group of references that other educated people can see. And when they notice those, they like to talk about them. And when they inscribe the painting later on like sushi does to this painting, you get those references named. And that's where we might move into who was Sushi? Sushi is most famous, most famous poem along owed called The former owed on the Red Cliff. There's a ladder owed on the Red Cliff too. This is written during a period of sutures exile from CT. Remember, as we said, in the factionalism at court did not favor you. You could often be exiled and sushi is serving away from court in a far away part of the empire. And while he's areas lots of time to write poetry, to do calligraphy, and even painted some and comment on his friends paintings. And these are gentlemanly activities. Remember from our course on Six Dynasties Period, self reflection and self cultivation, but also renewed now within the Song dynasty Confucian ideas. So I think I have time to read through this. And again, this is not part of your exam materials, it's just good background. And remember this is written whilst who share is exiled from court. And he writes It was in the year-end whew, this is part of that cyclical calendar system updating one night pass the full moon and the seven pollutant. And the months correlate differently in classical Chinese because it's on a lunar calendar. So that's actually the seventh month is actually in August in the year 1082 when Master Siew that suture. His guest floated about at the foot of Red Cliffs. Light breeze came in area wave rose from the water. They left their read like boat drift where it would riding the nebulous nests at the great expanse. You see some of that metaphorical language. They're just floating on a river, letting the river take them wherever it well, they were filled from pleasure with drinking. They sang a loud and they tapped on the gun whales to keep time. The Casio or Oh, the magnolia sweet, we dash the light reflection. Oh, its brightness flows away. Turgid, turgid. Oh, the feelings in my breast. Afar, I seek my beloved, O heavens further shore. And I highlighted this in red because this is a classical reference. And get to that in a minute as we play out the rest of this month, guess one played the flutes, may accompany them in harmony with their singing. And the flutes low fluids sounds seemed, seemed resentful or even yearning like sops or complaints. Their echoes faded away unbroken like treads cause the dragon hidden deep beneath the waves to dance. The widow in her solitary boat, to weep. Deeply moved suture sat up straight and his robe and asked, how did this come to be? So? And there's a group of various kinds of references happening here, some of which you might be able to make even thinking about our last River painting, right? The nymphal law River. And the guest replies the sushi. In a poem, an excerpt from a poem he writes, he says The moon is so bright that the stars are few. Get crow flat, crows and magpies fly southward. Is this not a poem? It's how sound. You might remember who sounds? How is the father of Satcher who had a battle here at Radcliffe, is where sow was cornered by young master Joe. That's a reference to that battle in the second century and the beginning of the third century. Unquestionably hero of his age. Yet where is he now? Or what have you and me brother, where mere fisherman's and woodcutters and the sandbars at the river. Mayflies between heaven and earth like a single grain and the vast dark seed. We lament that our lives last but a moment, envy the endlessness of the long river. You might class poll of a flying transcendent, thereby room freely or clutching our arms the bright moon and have done with it forever. Wounds or references to sort of peeling off a mortal coil are dying. You follow an immortal into the immortal around or fall into the moon, reflecting in the water and drowned herself. Master Siew replies, Do you also know about this river and the moon at that which passes away as like this, which is a quote, why it's in red. And yet it has never gone. But waxes and wanes is like that. And yet in the end, never diminishes or increases. If we look at the situation from which from that changes, either heaven nor Earth has ever lasted more than just a blink. If we look at it from that which does not change, then neither things nor I will ever come to an end. What is there furthered envy. Only the pure reviews across the river in the bright moon between the mountains, my ears take the one and make it sound. My eyes and count to the other and make it visible. I can take these without prohibition, can use them without depletion. Depletion. These come from the inexhaustible storehouse of the Creator, the place for you and I may help ourselves. And the guests smile that his enjoyment at his quote, the things he just said, they wash their battles and poured once more. That has one more drink for the evening. When the snacks where I'll finished the plates and dishes piled wildly. They piled themselves up, pellet against each other in the middle of the boat. And before they realize the east had begun to lighten. So their party on the boat, they've eaten up all the snacks they've drunk themselves into, into sleep. And they fell asleep on one another floating down the river. So you're getting this construction that's really about kind of your place in the world and your contingency in terms of thinking about how long your natural life is. And all of these references again, are two very specific historical texts. Within their, within the o, there are at least three major citations that I highlighted in red that are politically inflected. And an educated viewer or read, would read those and realized that they were references to texts. And this is what literati is about, making these kinds of references that other educated people will get. It's like quoting Shakespeare perhaps nowadays. So the Casio or part is from fourth century BC poem, group of poems called benign songs by two u n, which is about a banish minister and the emperor who exiled him. That's exactly what's happened to sue. Sure. And that's why he's making this reference. The moon so bright, crows, magpies flying southward. This is a reference to something that's outside. The general who lost the very end of the Han dynasty, lost that battle. And after which the Han Dynasty breaks apart. It's in reference to an omen that was spotted by one of South-South guards, but that he ignored all group of crows, magpies flying southward. And then this other reference that which passes away like this, is unsurprisingly a quote from the Analects by Confucius and reference to the idea that the flows constantly as a metaphor for the potential for a person to be virtuous. So you can see embedded in this poem which is about drinking are all of these references that other educated folks would get that relate to Confucianism and relate to being banished from court. So that's a kind of brief run through of the most probably suture is most famous poem. How does that relate to this painting though? This painting is inscribed by that same person, sushi. And the painting itself as by men and went on one of his friends. You'll notice that this painting again is in black and white. And the inscriptions above here, R by, I think let's see. Like this one is Su Sure, and I forget who this oneness. The painting inscription which you've read for today, goes on to say, To describe sutures reaction to the painting. He says, I've said this a painting, men animals in buildings and furnishings that they all have constant form. Again, this is not a painting of people, animal or buildings or furniture, right? But as for mountains and rocks, bamboo right here, and trees, water and waves misses some clouds. Although they do not have a constant form, they have a constant pattern. Number your ideas a pattern principles ramp. If it fails, app your constant form, everybody knows it. But when a constant pattern is not represented correctly, even calling the sewers of painting to detect it. That is why those painters who would win fame for themselves by fooling the world, they all choose these subjects that have no constant form. Nevertheless, when the form is incorrect, the mistake is lifted to that. That's when cannot condemn the entire painting because of that single mistake. But if a constant pattern, again, we're talking about this pattern here and the landscape, the bamboo, et cetera. These are constant patterns. That pattern is wrong. The entire work has to be condemned. You have to throw out an, a whole painting if that pattern goes off. If the subjects forms aren't constant than the painter cannot be careful. That cannot be careful about its pattern. Among the artisans of the world, there are those who capture form down to the tiniest detail. But as for pattern, only a gentleman or draw ordinary talent can distinguish it. So you're getting vision in terms of painting theory between painting those things that I have strong form, right? Like chairs, buildings, people that are constant. These other sort of natural forms that have patterns. And you don't get the constant pattern right. Any has to be considered a wash, considered terrible. Whereas if you mess up on one constant form, it's just isolated to that part of the painting. And associative says on this inscription of the buy when tone, a painting which is about pattern right? Principles have bamboo. Only a gentlemen or literati, someone who's educated and thinks about the world and these new Neo-Confucian terms can paint as well as this. Only gentlemen paint like this. Artisans, people who just paint buildings and portraits. You know, that's a lesser kind of painting. And painting the patterns of the world because it takes an understanding of those patterns to isolate them and to produce them in an image such as this. And this is where literati painting starts to diverge in terms of its subject matter from other kinds of painting. Literati painting of this point onward is specific kinds of plants, bamboo and landscapes in particular. And starts to move away from the description of form as you see it in the world and toward these sorts of elaborated patterns of landscape and bamboo. Another Inscription on a painting by when tone elaborates on this idea. Sushi writes on X2, we'll call it bamboo the gentlemen and the whole nation referred to it that way. Today only went home is able to represent this gentleman that is bamboo form with ink. In his conduct when tone, the painter is solemn yet elegant, wise, and loyal. More than one of his very see cultivates an, educates himself, polishing and cleaning morning and night, all in the hopes of befriending him the bamboo. But this gentlemen and you're getting a conflation here that's purpose in sutures writing, but tweet the idea that when told the painter is a gentleman because he paints the pattern of bamboo so well. And the idea that bamboo itself is a metaphor for being a gentleman. This simple yet unyielding can. Now he's talking about both bamboo, which is simple, quick growing plant. And yet it, it bends and stays firm. And so is when told by association, by metaphorical association. And frost, wind and rain, this gentleman remains unaffected. Here we're talking about bamboo. It's also about when tone dwelling with others. He does not lean on it. Any of you have ever seen a bamboo sort of thicket? Everything unless one is dive and falling down, is growing straight and parallel and straight upward, right? So the idea that you're not leaning on people in depending on them, you have a kind of solidity to you, a kind of consistency that maintains your own upright behavior. And so if we think about this painting in particular in terms of literati painting, which began discussing all the way back with Wang teacher and with the caterer painting. But that really come into full force again at, in the painting of the Song dynasty. We're getting some of these ideas of Neo-Confucianism coming to the fore. And we can think of a painting life isn't an extension of the Song dynasty ideals of observing, understanding the principles of the world. Something that Cuo Shi Guo So talk about. Well, which is also something that sushi is talking about in his inscription here, right? Patterns of the world. The idea of pattern and form. Literati are also focuses on how to be a proper gentlemen, how to be an educated, elite person in terms of your references to the past, in terms of your own personal behavior, especially in the face of politics. And in some ways, the rise of this style of painting is an extension of the kind of factual misbehavior at court. If you look back to the kind of person sushi cast himself as an exile or the kind of person that suture describes when tone is being. It's all about being upright and moral and virtuous like a good Confucian person. And then when you demonstrate that in your poetry, you're calligraphy and painting is in your choice of references in these reinterpretations of past texts or poems or styles, even at the style of who cadre in relationship to the style of legal mins painting. And in the embedding of those sorts of ideas and metaphors. Nature as well. Like landscapes or in bamboo as suture talks about in relationship to this painting. All right, before I move on to the last object, Any questions about this? But just asked this practice, we have all the way going back to like Mark, either Zheng was buried with musicians that stop at this point you have appointed this had stopped. People were allowed to kind of die and do their own thing on their own schedule. So, so yes, cause she was not buried with them Persians all. This takes us to our last painting them, we've talked about. To paint it dismayed at the time of inversions, only bamboo ink painting made outside of the court. For these Literati who are trying to exchange ideas about how virtuous they are through metaphorical use of references to the past. And I mean, it was made for court propaganda to convey the benevolence of Emperor Shun zone and these new policies by Wang on sure how they would bring prosperity to the kingdom or to the Song dynasty. Align to the last emperor who ruled the northern territories of the Song Dynasty. The last emperor of the Northern Song. Just like his predecessor emperor stands on Quezon. One of the key issues during Quaid zones reign was the way in which the court and the officials at court, that is the way in which the emperor and his officials related. When Emperor equate XOM inherits the throne. But 16 years after his and believe it's his grandfather who was Shenzhou dies. The Court is still divided by this sort of factional politics that resulted from the sort of policies before by Wang ensuring the debates around those policies. But which zone is interesting in part because he never expected to inherit the throne. He was not the first or second son of the previous emperor, but a few people unfortunately died. And he was given the throne. But he had cultivated his whole, whole life. Aid cultivated himself as one of these ideal gentlemen and in Neo-Confucian sense. And so when he came to reign as emperor weight zone, he was very interested in the R and in this literati behavior that we just talked about in relationship to. Tongs painting. And he really, through visual means and through literary means, tried to cast himself as the kind of ultimate Neo-Confucian official. And part of the way he did that was through his own painting, his own poetry, and his own calligraphy. He was recognized as a phenomenal painter, calligrapher, and poet in his day. Although I guess who argues with the emperor, the painting Academy that had been instilled under Emperor Shun zone with painters like cause she was formalized. It was a curriculum taught these painters had to paint well for the court. And the court was divided into the kinds of painters that sushi talks about. Literary painters at gentlemen painter's, an artisan painters, people who painted lesser forms like architecture or portraiture, et cetera. And for most of wave zones, rain. He threw the Arts, established this idea that everything was caught on and harmonious and that it was a return to ancient classical sage kings, the kings that existed even before the Shang dynasty. And he was a kind of continuation of that. And so this is the kind of person that weighed zone was. And all of these talking point, same as in the previous slide. And again, part of how Quezon conveyed that was through his own painting. This painting called a literary gathering, gathering of litter insulin is actually painted by the emperor himself. And this was relatively rare, especially for that's point. And you can see that the painting shows a group of scholars seated around a squared with a laid out before them and a bunch of servants serving these scholars set around this square table, which is in a garden setting outside. There's a little balustrade around the garden, which leads us to believe this is probably within the palace grounds. And from your reading, their inscriptions, so the upper left and the upper right, one by the prime minister under Emperor white zone and one by the emperor himself. And again, here's detail of these guys all seated around this table outside this banquet. And it's important to note that this is an image of the emperor with his officials. Yet when we look at the image, it's difficult to tell who is the emperor and who were the officials. More of the things you take away from this is again, Quezon wanted to cast himself as a kind of the best among all of these literary gentlemanly officials. You can see in the background a zither or a chin. Or maybe it's a joke. Like, I don't remember which version of a kind of zither this is. And these are fine gentleman might play music for one another just as we read in sutures poem a minute ago. And it has inscription. He talks about this. He writes, Confucian gentleman abroad Florida, the SEC, a past, just as in the presence. And that's here. A rule in Hogwarts cooling. Hou Jin Tang. Sow confusion. Gentlemen have brought glory to the country both in the past and the present. Alight. Odes and poems singing from the end of their brushes, but are there or sober. So again, poetry is what a gentlemen, how gentleman expresses himself. And the drunken trope is one way of, I'm thinking about how you sort of loosen up your tone. Upper gentlemen, let your ideas flow. And it goes on in the second group of causes to say this, these many gentlemen crew, new knowledge under my role as in the time of Emperor weighed zone, I paint this image that the joy of being with these many literary talents. And so the inscription here is again, celebrating the emperor's equality with these educated ministers and embed it in the poem. There's another quote, classical quote to an Emperor of the Tang Dynasty Emperor type title. And that is the under my rule are in this world are many men of talent. And so he's using that phrase, which again, among literary educated gentleman would've been recognized just as slogans and might be recognized from American history by any of us, right? Like pattern and then come to mind four score and seven years ago or don't tread on et cetera. Embedded in his poem, born of these kinds of quotes. So classicism right there, literati citation as well of the past. And you then you see him among these other officials. And you can't tell the difference between him and these other talented men under his rule. But he's bragging about we're in kind of equal rule of talented government officials is part of what the image is conveying, as well as the poem. And that's conveyed in another sense, if you stop to think about it. In the fact that sijang, who is the prime minister under Emperor equate zones rule, hasn't IBD and the other corner at equal height, an inscription about this painting as well. So this is something made by the emperor which he allows one of his ministry to paint something or to inscribe his, his painting in an equal position to the emperor zone. And the emperor is both showing in the image and in the poem. He wants to be seen as, as an equal confusion official. And sagging writes, your servant, sijang, humbly submits this accompanying rhyme. And the rhyme goes, this brilliant era cannot live up to the tongue. So there's this again, recognition of the emperors quotation of the Tang Dynasty quote. Because the eight Tang Dynasty exemplars have all returned to the great path. They died. And yet what can we laugh? But what we can laugh about is that in those years, there were originally actually 18 gentlemen. Only the classes can tell us who becomes an outstanding talent. And so there's a, there's a little joke here. The idea that we remember eight talented ministers of Tang dynasty. But during the tongue itself, 18 were named, which is to say, no matter how great you might think you are in the present moment, only history and how it is written can canonized. You can create a position for you if you're not remembered in the histories, you are no longer one of the eight team gentlemen, which had been reduced now to eat gentlemen. And so again, in this image, you are getting the emperor putting himself as he holds among his ministers. And this sort of competition among them to be the most ever, you'd like to be the most talented comes out in a poem like this, who from among us will be remembered by history. Now, that brings us to the last point. The last vocabulary word which is, uh, has to do with the Jin Dynasty, which had been pressuring from the north During Emperor equations rule and eventually invades. In 1126, capturing the capital and capturing Emperor himself. The emperor is held in the north under Jin Dynasty, fulfill while his son them a court flys south to the jnana, which is modern day Hangzhou, to maintain dynastic rule over the southern part of China. And that's the Southern Song Dynasty. Emperor of waves on dyes on under, you know, as a prisoner in the north. Under Jin Dynasty rule. Part of how historians remembered him in his own time was as somebody so focused on the arts of being a proper Confucian gentleman that he neglected his other major responsibility, which was military defense of the boundaries of the empire. And Quezon is almost exclusively blamed for this fall because of the flowering them arts at court. So I've made it on time. Are there any questions in the last minute or two of class? Remember, I have my office hours at the end of the day if you want to talk to them. The word dirt in that grabs effect of the Jin Dynasty. They weren't han ethnic Chinese folks, they were a different ethnicity. The directions has paint on it away on silk paper. Because it's suspended in water, is to set all to light. So you can only have paintings like this out for very limited amounts Time. In fact, this all these paintings have very, very strict museum regulations on them in terms of how often they're brought out. His painting is brought out if you're lucky once every ten years. I was lucky enough to see it in 2008 in Taipei. But I don't think it's been shown since then. No other questions. You can see me my office hours. Remember to finish your reading assignment. And otherwise, I hope you have a nice evening. Take care.



## [08. Aristocratic Art in Japan](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/08-aristocratic-art-in-japan?module_item_id=2446437)
 I think you should all have full functionality in. You can hear me. If you cannot hear me, please just let me know in the chat window. And we'll go ahead and use this just as if we're using WebEx, relying mostly on the chat window and on the screen which I'm sharing with you now, which is the PowerPoint. It is recording and I'll post this on the website as well for those students who couldn't make it to class in person. So first off, maybe I want to get any questions regarding the assignment for your peer review. Out of the way, a lot of people have had trouble finding in Canvas where there particular classmate has been assigned to them. I can't see how Canvas tells you that, but what I've done is just Google canvas. Where do peer review assignments show up? And there are some how 2's on the Canvas website that walk you through that. Remember, Fats do just as you are all your all of your writing assignments are due on the date that the states there's no weeklong period for that. So that would make it this Thursday evening. And are there any questions about that that we can cover now before class starts? Any questions at all? Okay, see no questions. I will move us on to the content of this class. So with these next two classes, we're moving from China to Japan. Thinking about Buddha, start next class, but then thinking about aristocratic art, this class. And in some ways we might contrast that with thinking about the literati or elite arts of both the Court and court officials that we talked about last class in terms of Neo-Confucianism. But now we're thinking of how is it that this class of people communicates with each other through visual and textual means in Japan. So I want to start us off by doing a little bit of WebEx chat observations and again, trying to connect the texts that we have, a narrative text with. The image that we have, which is supposed to accompany that excerpt from the text I gave you, which is from chapter 40 called the law. That's the title of this chapter. From the book The Tale Of Gan Ji by Lady Maurice Saatchi. So having read that, and I'm looking at this particular image which is supposed to accompany that chapter. What moment in the narrative of the text do you think that this image is illustrating and why? What are the details that give you that? What details in this image tell you that what you're looking at is a particular moment within Chapter 40, the law from the tail Afghan genes. And once you feel comfortable thinking, You know what moment and what details leisure to that. Go ahead and throw it in the chat window and we will start discussing. So unless if WebEx continues to malfunction, then we will continue to use zoom. But for now, just use, continue to use the WebEx Link that's provided on the webpage as normal. This is a onetime exception, I hope. So. Thanks for asking that. A1. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm Mm-hm. I'm going to wait for a few more. Voice says only seven out of the 60 of you currently on right now are commented. So I'm going to wait for a few more ideas before we start discussing what we're looking at, which seems to be a little bit difficult to discern for a number of reasons which we'll discuss and how that correlates to what we've read. He said. Okay. All right. So it looks like there's actually quite an interesting consensus brewing among you that this is the moment where Kenji is weeping over the death of someone named Lady morass Zaki, who to clarify things is not the princess. If you read the text closing, there are a lot of characters in this novel. It's, it's a fascinating novel. But the characters that we're going to be focusing on are the three that we see in the scene. And that's one thing that some of you have discussed is that it's actually a little bit hard to see. The various figures are. There's one for you here in the foreground, right? Sitting with a tall cap and with short hair, which many of you are correctly reading as a male figure based on his dress and his hairstyle. There's another figure actually kind of pause for sec functionally. Are you seeing me drag the chat window across the image is interfering with the way you're seeing things or do you not see that when I'm when I'm posting the PowerPoint. Okay. Great. Thanks. Fantastic. Appreciate it. Thank you for letting me know. So you're getting Benji here in the front and he's facing a woman here who we identify as such, again, by her long hair, by the slight, very sort of find the detailed eyebrows and other features on her face. And the extra robes and layers of robes that define her body as it's seeded on this bench. This is like a short little bench that is only probably about a foot tall, but you can rest on when you're talking to people. Now, reading the scene is complicated, right? So we can make out these two figures quite easily. And the rest of what we see seems to be architecture, right? Here you have a series of blinds that are descending down with some textiles on them that appear to be able to be raised and lowered at a window. There are a standing column and a cross beam here with a bolt at the top. And that's repeated here as well. And so here you're getting more of these hanging draped separators that can fall down between beams and up to seperate rooms. And then you're getting an outside space where Ganges sittings, sitting on the cusp of this sort of outside space where there's a garden to the left and you see several sprays of grass sort of bending over in the garden outside. But there's actually one extra figure in here which some of you caught onto. And she's cutoff between what we're seeing as the roof beam and this cross piece of textile here, which would come down and form a kind of screen or window. And so you're getting this figure blocked out, meaning that she's less important to the narrative happening. But you can tell that it is a S0 based on the draping hair. This is an old image and so it's a little beat up. Some of it has been lost right, due to age and time. But there are actually these three figures present in the image. And that's one piece of evidence that helps you to begin to identify where you have a male figure talking to a female figure with another female figure boxed out by this roof beam. And it so happens that the male figures get Angie, female figures, lady murse Aki while she's still alive. And then the other figure is the princess herself, a younger woman who's come to visit lady Marie Zaki, who has been ill for some time, as you know through the reading. And so this is actually before Lady murse OK. Is died. Most of the weight of the text I gave you, right, is all about how Kenji, and again, the title here is the tale of Benji, right? So we know that he's the main character. It's actually the majority of the chapter I gave you, which is just the very end of this chapter, is all about how Ganges mourning the dead body of Lady Mary sock and contemplating whether or not he should have allowed her to take her Buddhist oath and become a nun in her later years. Or whether he himself should take the vows of Buddha. A monkhood as a sign of kind of reverence and an morning. This is how moved he is. He's considering becoming a monk. But again, if we stop and think about how it is that we're reading the scene, we have to understand some of the conventions of looking at this kind of painting which has what's called a blown off roof. It's as if you have a kind of doll house structured by the strong parallel lines and the spaces that get box out that are rooms. But you've taken the roof off and this expression blown off or if it's used mainly by a later commentators, art historians describing this effective looking down into. Various rooms to see what's happening, to see what sort of social interactions are happening. And you have Kenji talking with murse aki and the princess next to them. And outside there is the garden. And that actually points to a section that none of you honed in on. You all thought this was mourning mainly because of the way the bodies are completed right? Again to his head is bowed slightly toward the woman. And it's hard to tell from our modern perspective that she's not dead register actually bent over and weeping or hiding her face with her sleeve. And it's hard to tell what the other lady, the princess herself is emoting or how she's feeling because she's really barred out of the sea. But we're really getting is the interaction between murse Aki here and again G here in the center. And so that might lead you to another section of the text. If you look to the bottom of 739 and through to the top 740, that's the moment in the text we're looking at. And there are a number of ways in which we know that's other than the fact that murse aki is still alive. So if you'll remember, from the top of 739, you have morose Aki who's going in and out of this kind of state of sickness. And she cause one of the world's children are one of the children, come centered Tainter Neil, a son of the princess. And they have a chat about the Buddha and about plum blossoms and about the coming cool of autumn season we're experiencing jest right now and she begins to feel a little better. This is the full the second full paragraph on 739, but the slightest exertion was sufficient to cause a relapse in her, in her illness. And this continues on and gives us the entrance of this, of our next two characters, right? The time for the princesses returned to court had come and Marist Zaki long to beg for an extension of her visit. But the emperor was already chafing at her long absence. Messengers were continually arriving from coordinate would have been a pertinent to detain her for more than a few hours longer. Since it was out of the out of the question that murse Aki, that's our older, more mature woman here, should pay the customer a visit to the French court is the princess contrary to all precedent condescended to visit her. And that's our princess down here in the foreground. The sick woman that's murse Aki felt embarrassing, causing this difficult too, but she long passionately to see the girl once more. And finally, the world gear was carried to the Main Hall. And this is really the beginning of the scene that we're in right now. A cold wind had sprung up toward evening, but morose Aki, wanting to get a better view of the garden, had been helped onto a couch by the window. Kenji was delighted to see her capable of so much exertion. You seem to get much better today. He said, I believe it has given you new strength, had the princess near you. So there's our triangulation of murse aki, and this is what we're calling a kind of little couch, right? Again, G who's talking to her and saying why? You look better today. And the princess who is near him being the cause, Gan, She thinks of her better spirits and are better help. His delight at her sympathy. Suppose an improvement only brought home to her all the more poignantly how terrible the blow was that awaited him. And you're getting this interior sort of set of feelings from murse AKI, as she hears Ganges exclaim, OK. You seem to be getting better. She is moved by the fact that he doesn't think that she's actually going to die, but she herself knows it in her response to him. Is it a poem? And this is important to some of the content that we're talking about end to the image that we're looking at here. So she responds to him, hopes than the dew drop upon the windswept grasses at the Heath to build a safe abode. Such was the acrostic poem she recited. And he responds in another poem, where all things raise some madly to their doom. Why think of one fragile do drop will be the first to reach the destined goal. So hold onto those lines for a moment. Now she's at presently you had better go back to your rooms. I'm feeling very Gideon though I would forgive. And though I know you would forgive me if I did not entertain you properly, I do not like to feel that I have been behaving badly. Her screen of State were drawn in close about the couch. The princess didn't hold a nurse, OK, he's hand in hers. She seemed inclined, indeed to be a fade, to be fading that could do drop from the grass. That's a reference back to the poem that they were just talking about. So certain seem the approach of death at messengers were centered in every direction to bid the priest read scriptures for her salvation. But she had more than once recovered from such an attack as these. And it was hoped that this was merely another onslaught of the possession. Attacked her years before. All that long, various prayers and incantations were kept going, but in band, she died the next morning soon after. So this is late immerse. Ok, he's last night on Earth. And what I want to call your attention to most, as is the fact that this poem is the way in which Moroccan Benji, who were lovers, recited their emotions to one another. They encapsulated their feelings in his poetic lines and these metaphors about nature. Her line to him is hope, stand the dew drop upon the windswept grasses of the Heath to build a safe abode to and politicize that. What she's really saying is that how can I do drop and a dew drop, as most of you probably know. But just to sort of be explicit, the kind of condensation that happens overnight on plants that then usually burns away and the next day with sunlight. So the length of a dew drops life is usually not much further than the morning. And then on top of that, she's talking about dew drops on windswept grasses. Saying if I'm a dew drop, this is the analogy. How do I have any hope of really surviving for that long of a period of time in the world. And then he responds, picking up on all of this ideas of sort of the impermanence of the world and, and how quickly one's life goes. He says, where all things race so madly to their doom. I think one fragile do drop will be the first to reach the destined goal. He's basically saying, you may be a dew drop on windswept grass as if that's the metaphor we're using here. But everything must come to an end. And why must do drop come to an end before any other any other living thing. He's saying, You still got some strengthen you and I can see it more or less. And these poems are important again for the way in which people at court at this time spoke to one another with coded references. And this is a lot like the kind of coded references we talked about in the rise of Neo-Confucianism in China. But in a different context entirely. This is poems being exchanged at court among aristocrats to convey their feelings to one another. And the key to this image is not just that you have these three images, and that's these three people in the image. And then it comes after the text itself. But to identify the moment in the text of this chapter, have the painted garden reiterating that poem. And that's the sort of key visual trigger for anyone looking at this image that allows them to know exactly what moment this is here you have these windswept grasses, which are exactly the metaphor that princes murse Aki gives. And the idea of dew drops on those grasses is signaled here by something that you can't see for a variety of reasons. And that is that the painter has gone in with gold and silver and painted those mists of golden silver across this paper. If you were looking at this in real life, as you moved the light, it reflected off of that gold and off of that silver would move as well, flickering and bouncing in the image that the left enlivening it looks very dead to you now, right, barely visible, but it'll come alive and sparkling in the light and allow you to think that swept or the windswept grasses would do on it. And that's the moment in the text that we are looking at precisely because that's the poem associated precisely boost chapter. And precisely with this sort of tension of emotion between murse, OK. You know, she's about to die. Gan Ji Hu hopes that she won't. And they, in case that within these poetic references, which are illustrated here, just as a kind of side note, over in the garden outside of where Kanji is visiting. And again, the reason you can't quite tell that is because you're not seeing the object and person. Photos. Photography is still light, right? And so you're just getting one bounce light off of this painted image. But if you were in person, this whole left side will be sparkling, like do on windswept grasses. One last thing I want us to think about. And again, you can go ahead and add this into the chat window. Is this question of how is the above image which we're encountering here in the word are we in the 12th century, this is when this image is from in Japan. How has that similar or different to the kind of narratives that we've already talked about in painting. Whether it's the Wu family shrine image of Goenka in the assassin or the Cu Chi Jew painting of soldiers poem. And when you have an idea, just go ahead and throw it in the chat window. Kind of compare and contrast here. Okay. Greg, collectively, you're coming to it, but I want to straighten out a couple of the responses, right? So there, this image that we're looking at here from an illustrated version, a 12th century illustrated version of the tail of Kenji is exactly like our image of the family shrine. Carvings in that. As you else, as many of you said, it's, it's a single scene, narrative, right? It's distills the whole text of the chapter which has, you know, has lots of moments in it, right? Many of you thought, well, this must be the morning scene where they converse, OK, he's already dead. There's thoughts of temporal moments, moments in time in the narrative can't put into a single scene like this. And so you take the moment of highest tension, right? That her last night on Earth, lady Murdoch, his last night on earth. The poem as reflected in the landscape and these emotions that their bodies are trying to convey. And you distill it into one single image. So it's like a single scene, narrative, again, picking the moment of highest emotional tension. So you are all great, sort of identifying that. But this little excerpt here from the cool kid, your hands grown. Again, look, I'm sure hands well is different, right? Because you're getting the repetition of characters continuously in a landscapes. And here in our murse, aka image, which will go into little more detail on an image, you get alternating text and single image, text and single image. So it's not like the glue hide your hands crawl and which you have a continuous narrative in which the landscape helps to chop things up. But as some of you said, some of you rightly said, nature plays an important role in the fact that the landscape outside of the scene and the metaphor of the poem that they're talking about. Or the two are the sort of significant textual aspects that allow us to identify where this visual image is happening. And also to kind of encapsulate that emotion within a single poetic line, right? A well-educated person in Japan and knew the tale of Benji, if you said simply that line about the windswept grasses in the Do they would know you were pointing to the moment where Ledi murse Zaki dies. And so this metaphorically use of landscape is the same in both of them, right? Because our nymph of the Loire River is talked about in metaphors of landscape. And she herself is a personified landscape. And then some of you also said that the style is quite similar as well, right? You have an outlining with and relatively flat color washes. And a lot of the emotion is conveyed with the gesture of the clothing and with this sort of posturing of the body, the faces themselves are actually very simply conveyed, right? You're not getting great big expressions. It's more about the body posture and about little subtle differences in eyes, eyebrows and Maos, which are all fairly composed actually. So for Lady murse Aki to be overcome by the emotion and thinking about Kenji sued having to deal with her death. She just covers her mouth and that's it. You're not getting great big gobs of tiers. Instead you get dew drops on the grass, right? And so if we compare each of these, they each bear certain kinds of similarities to this image in, that was made in Japan during the 12th century, right? So certain ideas about how it is you convey a narrative visually and how it is you use the landscape especially to kind of emphasize the human emotions. We might draw contrast to both of these previews images. So that's really great feedback. Good job guys. So that's our kind of interactive moment. You can sit back and ride the my narrative train for a little while longer here. Just to sort of recap this, when we're asking in one of our big open general questions, you know, how does the image, the tail of that you have here tell the story, the written story visually. We can see that there is this blown off roof, right? So that we get a glimpse into the architectural space of the palaces. And we get the moment of highest tension in the chapter conveyed in this image. And we also look at the landscape getting used as a metaphor. And that's where one of your vocab words comes in as well. The walk-up poems. That is another name for these acrostic poems as they're described in the the text itself. These walk-up poems are the ways in which people at court, not even just in stories, but in real life and medieval Japan, aristocrats spoke certain kinds of ideas to one another. And again, it's a lot like the kind of analogy of quoting Shakespeare to somebody, right? You have to have had a certain kind of fundamental education focused on certain Anglo angler, Philip tech striped people interested in Shakespeare and interested in celebrating that particular background will quote those lines to one another. As similar kinds of emotions exist in real life. And that's, that's what's happening here more, more or less as those quotes, the poems that I've come up with by these characters were quoted in real life at court. And people created their own poems at court to speak deep emotions to one another through the kind of guarded and intellectual allies, language of poetry and of metaphors. So that's how this images in these narrative hands grows in Japan are telling stories, right, with single seen images, the moment of highest tension. There's a lot of architecture involved to structure the scenes more so than the narratives that we've looked at so far in China. And this blown off roof technique, it helps you to peek in. But really it's the poem that we want to focus on as well. Read the walk-up homes they speak, illustrated in the landscape and the landscape. Metaphors and both the poem and in the image, helping us to know what emotion to be feeling here. What part of the story where n and this particular painting, which again is from one of the chapters of the tail, of the tail again, G is something like 60 chapters long. It's, it's, it was a massive book. The first novel in recorded history. And it alternates the texts of the chapters which I've also given you in your images for today, which are then followed by one image from one part of that text itself. And this particular hence row that we're looking at is one of a set of relatively early hand scrolls depicting the events of the tail of dengue, which were written in the 11th century. So these are some of the earliest versions of this text written out and illustrated. And you'll see as well that the paper on which the calligraphy is written has silver and gold speckled background as well. These were relatively high class productions of this tale, of this novel. And each of the chapters gets its own kind of a version of this right? Here's chapter 39, the evening mist, which conveys, I'm not actually sure what this is about. I haven't read the whole TVC engine myself, but you obviously have a man and a woman discussing a piece of textile or something over here on the left. And then hidden behind the wall. You have to women over hearing them. And then here you have another woman about to sort of step out toward the garden scene with a long and flowing robe that marks her as perhaps the protagonist of this chapter and tucked away in the corner behind these screens. Another couple of characters again looking in. And so many of the scenes in many of the images here are, are displaying the same kind of upper-class aristocratic life that are described in the novel. And that people who commissioned these kinds of paintings and calligraphy could afford. And so what is this story about? What does it tell dingy about and what does it have to do with this new moment in Japan where we're intersecting Japan, right during or calling in general the sort of medieval period during. 11th, 12th century Japan. The images from the 12th century, but the story itself was written a little bit earlier. Just to think about kind of where we are in the chronology of things. Remember that the last object that we associated with thinking about Japan was from several 100 years before this frat. You're talking about 500 years before the painting we're looking at now. We will look at another object, a commission by the courts, by the prints, by the aristocrats at court for the promotion of Buddhism. I'm not happened in the late US hookah period. There was a period of transition of less than a 100 years with the capital move to a city called Nada. And Nada was the place central Buddhist warship in Japan. And you'll see again that this site here of this shock, a triad made during this period was at Nora, again denoting that kind of connection specifically to Buddhism that the city had. And the Buddhist church was so powerful in Japan at this time. Remember, we can think about the reactions against but isn't were happening in China at around the same time. Buddhism is still quite popular and powerful in Japan. And it's so popular that the capital is move to this city of Buddhism, of the major church centers of Japan. Because of that tight connection and because of perhaps a little bit to, to close a connection between the aristocrats were a family in the church. That capital period doesn't last long. And Nora, before it's moved to the hey, hey, I'm which is an old name for the city of Kyoto. And that's where do we get the name for the hay on period. And so you can begin to see that, whereas in China and in Korea you're getting rain names and dynastic names that carve out certain periods of history. In Japanese history, for the most part, the name of where the capital exists is how periodization is form. So Nora than ARRA period is when the capitalists and Nada, the hay on period is when the capital is in hay on. And that's again where we're intersecting with our story of Lady Morris Zaki and other kinds of aristocrats, wealthy landed gentry in Japan at this time. So as just mentioned, during the hay on period, the Royal Court moves from Noir to hey on Kill, which is modern day Kyoto. And unlike what begins to happen in Japan and China at this time, where you've gotta transition toward a meritocracy right? In hay on period Japan, it's still the aristocrats that hold most of the power. Old landed families, and that doesn't dissipate for the rest of Japanese history, more or less. Unlike in China where you have this centrally controlled dynastic empires, you still have more of a feudal government where families with largest states in certain areas have a kind of grounded control in those areas. And the emperor is the central figure around which those various provinces are organized. But the various provinces are largely in the control of local families, these aristocratic, major aristocratic families. And as we'll discuss later in this class and other classes, that's where a lot of the politics in Japanese history comes from. Fighting between these aristocratic families. During this period, you really get a rise in the written arts in Japan, which is part of what we're going to be discussing here. You get the invention of new kinds of poetry. You get the repetition of certain kinds of poetries that are dependent on Chinese models, like the walk-up poems used at court. And you get memoirs from people at court like Lady murse Aki will talk about her memoirs in a minute. And you get this novel, this kind of writing which is fictional, although it's thinly veiled fiction. And talks about the emotions and hopes and desires and possibilities for these various fictional characters within a realm that looks very much like the realm at court. And as I said, this particular story that the tail of Ganges is considered by most world literature scholars to be the first novel in world history. Where you have a whole host of different characters and developing kind of story arcs that all tie around a sort of central arc of this one person's life. The Tale of Kenji. Later chapters actually get into his son and his grandsons life. During this period. Again, as I've, as I've tried to emphasize in the last slide, the Buddhist church and the clergy are still quite powerful. And again, this stays so for most of Japanese history. So despite the movement of the capital to this new place, to dissociate the aristocratic families and the court from the Buddhist church. Churches located and Nora, the Buddhist church is still quite powerful and we'll get into that next class especially. But you can see it in the tail of Kenji excerpt that we, that we read today where again, G and Versace both wanted to become or to be ordained as priests or nuns. During this time. Despite the fact that you get a kind of rise in very Japanese specific styles of painting and of culture with these poems in his novels, there's still quite a large connection to China through the conduits of religion and of trade in general. So Buddhists, Buddhism and Buddhist church helps to connect Japan with China in the mainland. But you're getting a slightly decreasing reliance on these Chinese models and you're getting the development of more Japanese specific styles of painting and decorative arts that don't exist and don't come from. Mainland. So who is Lady mers Sasaki? Who? She's an actual historical figure. And the woman in the novel named Lady murse aki is not entirely the same as the person writing the novel. Many of Lady Mirsky's life events are modeled after the real late immerse Aki, the woman who wrote the novel, The Tale of Kenji. And that's why we think of it as kind of thinly veiled set references to actual events at court. The novel is fictional, whereas the author of the novel, who was also named Lady morris OK aim or Asahi. She Q2 was a daughter of one of these major aristocratic families during the medieval Japanese period and 11th century. She was born in, to a minor branch of one of those major families, the Fujiwara clan. And when you had sons and daughters as aristocratic families in Japan, what you tried to do is to place them in positions close to or relative power. And so Lady murse aki was made to be a lady in waiting to the princess, princess OK eco, which again are fictional character of Lady Mary Zaki is also a lady in waiting to the Princess and that story as well. So you can see a lot of the source material comes from Lady Murdock is real life. Murse Aki Sheehy booth, if the historical lady Morris Aki, wrote the tail again, G, right around the turn of the 11th century from around 100 thousand or so, two, 10-22. Mm. It, As you probably picked up on, is a romance at heart. It's A-B. Various liaisons are romantic adventures of dengue, which is where it gets its title from. Later chapters then go into the romantically is unzip his son and his grandson. And so it's about love, it's about sex, it's about psychologies of relationships. And it's also about court politics. And all of this comes into play in the novel. If you're interested in reading it, it's structured a little differently than many novels that were used to reading. But it's an interesting insight into again, thinking about how somebody like Lady murse aki and historical figure lived her life at court, even in this sort of fictionalized version, which as I've said a couple of times now, is generally considered the first novel. And world history, a complicated narrative of interweaving fictional characters with a kind of emotional pole for the, for the novel. Overall, there are 54 chapters and within those chapters, there are almost 800 of these Walk a poems. So you just read to walk a poem lines that we associated with the landscape painting aspect of the image. Which helped us, as I said, to identify where in the narrative we are. But in these 54 chapters, I mean, you're getting almost quick math here. 15 to 20. Set right? Yeah, 15. Math ten. Somewhere between 1050, somewhere between 1520. Let's say, I can't do math. Poems in each chapter, right, where you're getting all this. Thank you. Call I appreciate that. Quick math. Where you're getting all of these references about emotions that are coded in these poems. And again, this is a very complex plot that unfolds over these 54 chapters. You probably had trouble differentiating who was doing what because of these names. Just in the excerpt I gave you wish suddenly part of Chapter 40. But there are over 400 different individual actors in this fictional world that lady murse Aki models after her own experiences at court, being Lady in Waiting to the Princess. One of the fun things about this is that we can think about this novel in relationship to the diary that the real lady murse, OK, he also kept and we have got the whole thing but fragments of it. And I don't know if any of you are old enough to have watched or be interested in Gossip Girl, but it's very much in that vein. It's juicy. There's a lot of shade being thrown. And it is a fun kind of personal reflection on what life is like a court, for instance. Yeah. Thank you, Melanie. I appreciate that. It's I'm old enough to remember that whatever existed before Gossip Girl as well. But I mean, just take, for example, this particular excerpt from her diaries that I'm very vain, reserved, unsocial, and wanting always to keep people out of distance, living all the time and a kind of poetical world of my own and scarcely realizing the existence of other people, save occasionally to make a spiteful comment upon them, such as the opinion that most strangers hold. So what's fascinating about this diary entries that it's a reflection on how other people see her, right? Which is a relatively complicated psychological act. Not to say that people weren't doing that all the time in medieval Japan, but to write about it in this way and that is self-reflective. Again, we don't see a lot of writing from early periods in history that has this kind of psychological self reflection. And then she says, but actually I'm not the kind of person when they get to know me, she says they find to their extreme surprise and I'm kind and gentle. And in fact quite a different person from the monster date. Imagine. Nevertheless, I know that I had been definitely set down at court as an ill natured since Soyuz preg. Nothing my mind very much for I'm used to it and I see that it is due to things in my nature which I cannot possibly change. She's basically saying, like everybody thinks I'm kind of an asshole, sorry, a jerk bag. But, you know, but I don't mind because it actually kind of keeps some of the some of the difficult parts of being a court bearable to think that people that people think that you're meaner than you are. And then once they get to know you, they actually discover you're a nice person. So again, the psychology of being at court. Here is another, even the medieval Blair. A good, a very good connection. Thank you for my Gossip Girl deep cut. Here's another one that's even better. Will appreciate this. So laid him or Zaki in her poem or in her diary, is describing this other lady at court who she doesn't really like very much. She says, say shenanigans most marked characteristic is her extraordinary self satisfaction. But if you examine the pretentious compositions in Chinese script, which he's scatters so liberally over the court. You will find them to be Amir patchwork of blunders. So in this first section she's saying this other person at court, this other Lady in Waiting say shown Agon, loves to get attention by writing Chinese poems and Chinese script. And that's an aspect we're gonna get to in a minute at court. And basically making sure everybody reads and writes. She's scattering them liberally at court. But murse, OK, he says, This sort of attention grabbing personality, which she really doesn't like that much. Not only is she a kind of attention grabber, bought her Chinese poems are full of mistakes. And so she's saying she's based upon this person, an idiot, and a grandstand. She goes on to. She says her chief pleasure consists in shocking people. And as each new eccentricity becomes only two painfully familiar, she gets driven to more and more outrageous methods of attracting notice. Again, some serious shakiness at the court during the hay on period. And a lot of it we get from Lady murse, OK, is tale of Benji, but also from her actual diarrhea where she tells us about all of the kind of poor behaviour and unladylike behavior that's happening at court. So let's turn to some of the writing and think about what we know from Mirsky's diarrhea and from her novel about the use of poems at court. And also the fact that again from this detail we know that latest court or writing in Chinese script. So that brings us to the other part of the image that we haven't talked about yet. In fact, that this hand scroll is not just about an image. It actually has the whole text of the tail of Kenji Chapter 40 that precedes it. And then you get the image at the end to kind of solidify that emotion that you get when finished reading it, right? It's chapter image, chapter image. Now, as I just said from the excerpt from the diary, lady murse Zaki is noticing that the poor Chinese at other ladies at court. Remember this image here is from the back of the Chaka triad. This is the inscription in Chinese characters of the It's dedicatory script about print show tofu in 622 dying. And then I'm dedicating this statue to him and 623. This is a very different script. And we're going to go into the differences between the Chinese that was used in early periods in Japan to right the chinese. It's still being used at court. Unless script, which is different, it's written in a way that fully conveys the Japanese language. And that's the difference is that Chinese writing does not actually convey all of the subtleties and differences of Jap, the Japanese language. There are two grammatically very different languages. So if we talk about the development of the Japanese writing system, as you already know, the earliest writing that existed in Japan was in Chinese. And our earliest examples that we find coming from the mainland are dated to about 100 AD. So during the Han dynasty in China and during the year motto period in Japan, some of these early periods where the Japan hadn't been unified under an emperor's feudal law. Yet. At around the sixth century is when we begin to see signs of a kind of broad spread literacy among especially elites, aristocrats like the people at court. But to be literate at that time, meant to be able to read Chinese, again, are a prime example of that is the back of the Chaka triad from around the same time. It's dated to 623. And the arrival of writing and Japan really goes hand in hand with the arrival of Buddhism and Buddhist texts. So in order to read Buddhist texts in the Chinese, Japanese writing was crafted around the Chinese writing of Buddhist texts. But over the next couple of 100 years, which we've sort of skipped across here, right? We've gotta skip straight to the 11th, 12th century, the 11th century with our novel in the 12th century with our image and calligraphy. Over that period of time, a writing system that is specifically Japanese develops based off of the Chinese model. And there's a kind of interim writing called manure Uganda. And that is a system that actually use Chinese characters like this. But a Chinese person reading them would not be able to make sense of them because they were only used for the sounds that were similar to Japanese. And again, that idea of taking the sounds of Chinese and divorcing them from the meanings of the characters. It's actually again, something that comes in through Buddhism. So when original Sanskrit words came to China with the spread of Buddhism, Chinese words without actual meaning, we're use to approximate their meaning. So for instance, the word AMI Taobao Buddha is written with these particular characters. Amit is the first one, Me tor four, and the four is the Buddha. But these characters individually don't really have much meaning in Chinese. They're there for their sounds used to approximate the original Sanskrit word. Same thing is happening in the seventh, eighth century in Japan, Except to approximate the Japanese language using Chinese characters. It's all very complicated. But by around the year 1 thousand, you get the modern Japanese syllabary, the one that's used today, more or less of Conner. And those developed as simplifications originally of these Chinese words that were just use for their sounds. And so the Japanese writing system isn't always basically developed from the Chinese except for the fact that the spoken grammars so, so different. And we'll get to that. Next, I believe so. In order to kind of explain why you need these extra syllabary is of Hiragana and katakana, which we'll talk about in a minute. You have to know the basic differences between Chinese and Japanese. So if you have a basic verb, like to come lie in Chinese, the Japanese pronunciation of that before written, Chinese came to bear at least one version. There's multiple ways to pronounce some of these words and Japanese was cuter. And the difference between Japanese and Chinese is that Chinese doesn't chinese verbs. Chinese. Well, I confront you have nouns that changed gender. Chinese, Chinese verbs don't adapt at all. They don't change according to tense, right? There's no conjugation is the word I'm looking for. For Chinese, all you do is you modify the words before and after, you add other words that are separate, right? So the polite form of to calm is always going to be the same as the verb to comply. You just might add a kind of polite form of address to the beginning of it, to the person. Negative, you just add sort of adverbial negative of Buddha. Hi. Present tenses lie, the perfect tenses lie, the past tenses lie in Chinese, it's always the same. You just change the time words that come before it. In Japanese, the verbs conjugate. So for any of you who have taken a foreign language, especially French or Spanish, right? Or if you've really studied English, as hopefully most of you have. Not every high school English program and in the States is as good as the other, I guess. But hopefully a lot of you have spent time in your secondary education thinking about English grammar. Conjugate a verb. For instance, the verb to be changes based on your pronoun. It changes based on your tense. I am, you are. We are. I was, you were, et cetera. And you have to know how to change the chime, which is one of the difficult things about learning romance languages for people coming, for instance, from a Chinese background and Japanese, There's conjugation as well. And in order to get that conjugation, you had to create this extra syllabary to create those extra sounds, right? So this is always just li, li, li, li. The kanji, which is that the Chinese character has to have the addition of the conjugated sounds added onto it, right? And that's where the red, which is the Kanji, Who's getting these extra syllables, which are the Japanese syllabary is that we're talking about the connor. So the polite form of to come in Japanese is key Moss. Negative is Kornai, president, keep their perfect Keita. And so you cannot use the play in Chinese too, right. Japanese as it's spoken. There's the need for these extra syllabi barriers. And here's a chart to kind of show you some of those silvers. There are two main cylinders that developed one for foreign words and one for native words. Hiragana and cut the comma. And again, each of these develops this group of syllabary sounds, right? The KA-SAT time, my Ya Rao, or for all the sounds. And the, I use the ease and the owes. All of these sounds. They actually are derived from their abbreviations of those original Chinese words just use for their sound, the mano, Mano, Ghana, and the Hiragana, Katakana, both are abbreviations in that sense. And you can kind of see visually how this sound right with this horizontal line. And then you lift up and you get this kind of long vertical stroke and then this curved no stroke. How that is the cursive form of an, which is how you would pronounce the Chinese word in its original Chinese. And so the development of the written Japanese language is done through this several centuries long process of first only being able to write in Japanese and Chinese. And then slowly morphing through the example of those Chinese words used to describe Buddhist Sanskrit sounds into this syllabary kind of alphabet, right? As an analogy of sounds that compensate for all the things you cannot write just using Chinese. And by the ninth century, these different kind of systems, katakana. And here I'm gonna, I'm not gonna go into explaining why this is the G and not a K, but they're both Qanat system syllabary systems have fully developed. And again, as more or less how the modern Japanese writing system is. So you're getting Chinese words, sometimes called Kanji or hands. Chinese words which have their Chinese logo graphic kind of meaning right there, they're visual and they represent concepts. So you have to memorize the sounds that go with them. You cannot sound them out. And the syllabic system in which you can sound things out. So for instance, this word here right, has a Chinese pronunciation and the Japanese pronunciation in Japanese Sea. Which, and here's the kind of for it mimics more or less the Japanese words. And so that's the Carnegie for the word water, right? The Japanese or Chinese derived writing for the word water, which is pronounced Sui. You look at this, you have to memorize that it's pronounced Sui. But in Japanese, depending on the context, you can also use the native word for water, which doesn't use the Kanji and doesn't use the Chinese pronunciation at all, MSI. So again, you're having these two very different kinds of linguistic systems. And yet the writing system for Japanese is derived from the system that doesn't operate at all, like it grammatically. And that's about the limit of my ability to explain how the connection to the writing system in Japan is derived from Buddhist texts that come from China, which are themselves translations. And how a syllabary develops by the abbreviation of these, of these other Chinese words to compensate to create everything in between. And so when we're looking at this calligraphy, that's what we're looking at, this fully developed Japanese system of writing. And every once in a while in this script, I think you can pick out a Chinese word if you know how to write in cursive as this is written. But for the most part, this is all written in Canada. I'm not great at reading especially cursive Japanese. But here you see a he. I think that's a toll. And you can sound out this, write this script just by, excuse me, following along and sounding out the words. Which again is how you would read a word you don't know in English, a word you don't know when German and French, because they're based on that kind of syllabary you can sounded out, but you cannot do that. In Chinese. You have to know how the words are pronounced. You can't sounded out. You might be able to guess at the meaning visually, but it doesn't work that way. The same way as, as Japanese does in terms of this syllabary that gets developed by the time this hand scroll is painted because this hence calls entirely in that Japanese syllabary. So how are the calligraphy and painting relating? Here? Again, you're getting the alternation of the text from a novel written in this Japanese syllabary now so full on Japanese. Then you get the image that follows from the text is the same as the image is always drawn from the texts that proceeds it, right? And it's calligraphy is written in, in full-on, right? Japanese writing now so you get some Chinese words and they're read with their Chinese pronunciations. But for the most part you're getting this kind of system derived from the Japanese. So each of these chapters is written in its entirety, but only one moment from all of the narrative that's happening gets distilled, right, like our single seen images. One of the interesting things to note here that differentiates this from say, or other piece of calligraphy that we've looked at by Wang Xi j. Is it the emotions of the story seem to correlate to the structure of the organization of the calligraphy. As the story gets more intense and emotional, the lines tend to cramped together and become a little bit more excited or erratic. And so again, the art of calligraphy here, especially with its highly adorned background of this gold and silver paper is somewhat different than the art of calligraphy as we looked at earlier in China, right? You're getting a much more expressive use of the writing brush to correlate in some ways to the emotional peaks. Of story itself. And so one of the things we want to begin to connect to is again, the rise of Japanese specific models of thinking about storytelling. Thinking about the images that tell stories, and about the writing that tells stories here. And a move away from entirely Chinese models. This is not written in Chinese. It doesn't use entirely Chinese styles of Buddhist art, et cetera, are Buddhist kinds of figure painting, et cetera. And said We're getting a shift to a visual language and written language that are distinct to Japanese culture. And the rise of a Japanese style of painting, sort of rigid outlining. And these figural paintings in particular that move in very characterize characteristic sorts of ways with his blown off roof architecture. Highly colored, looking into these kinds of architectural spaces that structure, these interactions between the figures in the painting. All of this we associate with a word called Yet you Amato a or the painting a of your motto of Japan. And commentators at this time already begin to describe the distinct Japanese style area motto style of these images and of this kind. Writing and poetry and calligraphy. So a shift away within aristocratic Japanese culture from a dependence on Chinese models as had existed to some degree before. And that wraps up the lecture for today were done a few minutes early, and I'm happy to take any questions as you have them. And thank you for being flexible with the meeting. We're going to try to go back to WebEx. So pretend that this is just a one time fluke. And thus WebEx becomes terrible for whatever reason, in which case we'll just stay stay tuned. So again, the instructions I I I've tried to make as clear as possible the instructions for your peer review. But it's a little complicated so you have to pay attention. There's a rubric for the peer review under the assignment labeled peer review. So go there to look at how you're supposed to compose your peer review. But because of the way that Canvas structures this, you actually have to go back to the original assignment, which is I believe where you can also see who your posted peer review partner as and write your review on to their original comments onto their original post. Now, because Canvas is kind of a cow, it's left the rubric that I used to grade there for you to play with. Don't bother with it, please just leave that alone. Do the rubric that you find in the peer review assignment. That's the rubric you should be following to write your assessment of your peers work within the original essay. And if you click the link to the assigned name, you should be able to go to that original essay. And again, to write the peer essay, you have to do it in the original assignment, which is I believe where you can find where your partner is. In order to figure out how you see where those things are. All I did was Google, where on Canvas to my peer review assignments show up. And you should be able to find a help page to help you find it if you have trouble. Great. Awesome. Thanks gave. And it looks like Melanie saying, you should have gotten Canvas, probably bombard you with emails, but there might be a link in there, sound searcher inboxes with the right keywords and you should be able to find it as well. Thanks everybody. I'll see you next Thursday through our normal processes, I hope, but stay tuned and if there's a crisis. Thank you.



## [09. Zen and Amida Buddhism in Japan](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/09-zen-and-amida-buddhism-in-japan?module_item_id=2446439)
 Alright, it looks like we're holding steady with our internet at the moment. I assume. I am being heard. Me. Blackouts for the mute, the microphone. Just as Drew said and the links for the reading for this class, we're in the same document. I haven't linked twice in order to make it clear that there were two readings, but they're in the same document. Your peer reviews are due today. A lot of you have had trouble figuring out where those are. Please follow the instructions or look to the announcement board where further clarification exists on how to access those boards. Again, that's due today. And unlike the first assignment, I'm not accepting any late submissions for this. We're done with that period up kind of grace of getting used to how things are due and so it's due when it's due so that I can bin begin grading everything. So there are there any questions about those assignments? I believe Mindy, if you're asking, where do you see the review written about your essay and believe that it will be posted within your response in the comments. So that's where people are posting them. That's why they're supposed to be posted. So that's where you should be able to read them as well. Any other last-minute questions about that? All right, let's start with class than. So today we're staying with Japan. And we're more or less in the same period. The late Heian period. And then we're going to move into the following period, which is called the comma Cura period. And we're talking about these two artworks in particular and what they have to do with that transition in Japan. But first, as with all classes, let's start with thinking about what we're looking at by describing what we're looking at. So in the chat window, make a comparison between these two images. What do you seeing? How do you think you're supposed to interact in person if you were to see each of these, what are the similarities? What are the differences or the material or otherwise? And what do you think each has a, if you can, if you can sort of make a conjecture based on what knowledge you have of this class. And then last thing, what are the readings have to do with each of these images? You know which one goes with, which I would assume. So. How did the readings in the image interact? So, take a few moments and write this out in the chat window and then we'll begin a larger discussion. All right, we've got a lot of good detail on this discussion. I forgot to grab a pen and paper, so I'm going to have trouble noting who said What here. So I apologize for the lack of shoutouts in this, in this discussion. But one of the interesting, uh, one of the interesting things I saw develop over the discussion was that at first, many people said, well, both of these are seated, men dressed in, whoops. And that's a kind of way in which both of these are quite similar. But as the discussion develops, some of you got a little bit more observant about the fact that the image on the left is a man seated in robes. Certainly an older man, as you can tell by the physiognomy of the way the skin wrinkles and droops and the way that he's bald with the big bags under his eyes, he hasn't it's not just about his lack of sleep. He's an older man. And the figure on the right draped in ribs, but standing and standing on a read. And some of you got that not only from observing and looking closely at what's under the feet of this man. Again, this is a relatively lightly painted image and we'll talk a little bit about why it is very lightly painted. But also from the context of the story about the man who travels across the river on a read man named Bodhi Dharma, very specific monk within Buddhist history. And both of these do represent specific historical figures, as you know from your descriptions. Or the one on the right, Bodhidharma, the founder of the sect of Buddhism called Zen Buddhism or chon in Chinese. And on the left, cogen, Japanese monk who will talk about first as we begin to kind of unraveled the stories of each of these two figures. And then one of the interesting things that, that came out in the discussion as well was in response to this question of how are you supposed to interact with each and I forget who it was that said this, but this was the spot on right? The, the sculpture because it's realistic, because it's seeded, because it's three-dimensional and approximately the same size as the human body. You relate to that, to that kind of an image quite differently than you do to a flat image with an inscription on it. An image that is very much like a physical body in real space, a sculpture. You relate to that as if it is another body in space. Whereas the image on the right takes a certain, a different approach, an approach of reading the image in a way there's less of a kind of continuity with the real objects and things of the world. Because it's flattened, because it's monochrome. That has one color because it's inscribed. And as the person who again to not get into shadow because I forgot to bring a pencil to scratch down names and ideas. As that person pointed out, you'd have to have a slightly higher education to fully interact with the image on the right, you'd have to be able to read because there's the poem at the top that I gave you an inscription and we'll get into that content in a minute. But it relates very directly to the story of who that person is, of who Bodhidharma is. Again, both of you, or most of you surmised correctly that we have two different monks here. And you can tell that by their simple robes, right? Their bodies are defined by the drapes of their robes. Whereas in a neoclassical kind of Western tradition or classical Western tradition, through Greece and Rome, many people think about the display of the body through particularly the nude flesh on, on, on figures, right? In most of East Asian and Asian art history. It's the robes and close that define figures. There are very few examples of the nude figure or body being celebrated and its physical nature in that sense. And so our robes here are really defining where the contours of the figure are, how it sits in space. And the image on the left. You have the sense that the robes are hanging with a certain kind of gravity directly down from the arms as the, as is the object in his hand. And then draped over each of the NEA is almost as if natural fabric would flow and that's very purposeful. Someone mentioned this in the comments as well. That part of this relates to the technique of assembled woodblock construction, and we'll get into that in a minute as well. And the robes on the right figure, again, they're very simply brushed with ink on. Paper. And they hang as if the body is standing in space, but they flow as well as if a wind might be picking up. I'm carrying him across these little waves at the bottom, under the feet, under reads. And so there are similarities and differences between what's being shown in each, um, a lot of them have to do with who these figures are, knowledge which she would have to have sort of coming to each of these. But what you could also read into the image. Some of you also talked about what they're doing with their hands, which is important, right? Both of them seem to be holding their hands together. The image on the right of Bodhidharma, his hands are held together in front of him under a, under the sleeves or outer part of his robes. And there's a little, I believe it can be made out like a little. Forget what what exactly this as it may actually be a set of a prayer beads hanging off to the right, to the right side, though I think it's more likely some other kind of handheld Labda because it's made unclear in the image. It's made very clear in this image what is being held. A rosary, a set of beads on a chain that's being counted off. And as some of you connected to the readings that have to do with this sculpture. This is a sculpture that is about a certain attitude toward where things are in terms of the Buddhist world, in terms of the kinds of cycles of birth and rebirth that define particular apex. And with the details of this particular prayer, the prayer that is being said as children as counting off each one of these beads. And we'll get into that as well with the details that we, that we connect to these images in a minute. And so again, we're thinking about modes of engaging audiences here. The image on the right has to be read, write, and associated with the story of Bodhidharma. For certain kinds of iconography, like the idea that Bodhidharma as the one will back it up. Floating on a read across a river. That object and ideas associated with that particular historical figure. The image on the right of the monk Cho gun as counting off his prayer beads. And this is something we associated specifically with Amit a Buddhism and Nim boots UX practice. I think I've got most of your comments from the discussion. But again, through your kind of detailed description and building off of one another, you moved from very simple kinds of contrasts that well, both by men that wear robes to thinking about the ways in which these two objects, while they both can convey images of monks, do so very differently because of their material and because of the way in which they're presenting two very different stories. One about the power of Nimbit suit prayer, and the other about the historical figure called Bodhidharma. So let's move now into thinking about a little bit of. Context of history. So the last time we spoke specifically about Buddhism, we talked about the traveling of Buddhist ideas across various routes of exchange. Whether it's envoys, traders, monks, moving across the various trade routes, specifically of South and East Asia. And conveying ideas of Buddhism with and we started off with Dunhuang. We talked about so Kiran. And then about the Chaka I add in Japan. We also had half a class about the reaction against Buddhism in the late Tang Dynasty in the ninth century in which we discuss the Rather query of the Buddha's finger bone. Next class will discuss Buddhism under the Mongolian period in China and especially this kind of Central Asian or Tibetan style of Buddhism. In this class, we're going to start off talking about AMI to Buddhism in Japan through this particular monk Shogun. So this is a different development or sect of Buddhism that gains popularity across East Asia when we're talking about it specifically in Japan. So again, our image of the monk Cho gun is seated here with the set of beads in his hands. And they're like a rosary or what? You would use a rosary AND catholic practice to say Hail Marys. And so each time you count off one of these beads, you say a prayer. M&m boots. That was actually a contraction of a longer phrase of the full phrase, the prayer, which has just praise be to Amit a Buddha. Now Mohammed up at x2. And this particular practice gained popularity in medieval period East Asia and then in both China, Korea, and Japan. And it revolves around possibly the simplest way of conveying your belief in Buddhism, just saying a prayer. And as each of your readings for this particular sculpture described, it's just the saying of this prayer once and with faith that will allow you to move into the Buddhist version of paradise to escape the wheel of rebirth and to be freed from the suffering of the world. Remember these tenants from our earlier discussions of Buddhism? But I'll meet a Buddha, is the form of Buddha the presides over the Buddhist paradise. After the historical figure of Buddha passes in his original sort of storyline. There all these other various manifestations of the Buddha and have Buddhahood in paradisiacal forms, in infinite forms, and in other kinds of worldly forms as well. We discussed with the taka tails all of the earlier lives of the Buddha. But then when he moves into enlightenment, there are all of these different kinds of cosmic and paradisiacal manifestations. And Amit a Buddha is the Buddha the presides over the Pure Land or the heavenly space I've Buddhism. So both of these texts talk about Pure Land Buddhism, which is also called amide Buddhism. So if the one on the left by, written by a monk named Shin ran from about the same time as our sculpture 13th century. He discusses nimbly to practice as such. I'm one of you discuss this in your chat contribution as well. It's, it's, it's a sort of dark vision of where the world has come. It begins, although I've entered the Pure Land path, that as I've begun thinking about AMI to Buddhism and the Buddhism that is about moving towards Paradise. I remain and capable of true and genuine thoughts and feelings by very existence is pervaded by vanity and falsehood. There's nothing at all, if any purity of mind towards others, we may each seek to conduct ourselves with the appearance of wisdom, of virtue and steadfastness. But within us, desire, rage in devious NUS are arrive. So that deceit in myriad forms permeates our existence. We cannot put a stop to our evil nature. Our minds are like vipers and scorpions. Even the good we may do is poisoned. And as practice it must be called hollow and Bain being unrepentant and lacking in shame. I have no mind of truth and sincerity and yet, and here's where the transition happens. So you have 3.5 full stanzas where he's just saying, I'm a terrible person despite the fact that I try to believe in Buddhism. And everybody's like this, our desires lead us astray. Eva, we pretend to be. Why is people on the outside? And then there's this transition that happens which is about than inputs to prayer. And children says in yet, because the name here, it's capitalize the name of Buddha has been given by amide Buddha. The universe is suffused with its virtues. Because one thing you can do as a kind of purifying mechanism. That's the way this poem describes him. And then he continues to get a little bit more self-aware. I guess we could say. He says as one lacking even small Love and small compassion, I gave a lot of thought to the good of others, if not, for the ship of amit as vow, how could such a person cross beyond this ocean of pain is to transcend the worldly realm and move into paradise with minds of malicious deceit, minds like vipers and scorpions. There is no accomplish and good acts through self-power. Unless we trust ourselves to AMI does giving virtue, you will die having never known true shame or repentance as a sign of a deepening of the five defilement all the monks and Lady of our times in externals display at the manner of Buddhists. Well in their hearts. They embrace non Buddhist teachings. Deeply saddening is it that in these times, but the monks and the laity, laity has just the common people in Japan while seeking to conform with Buddhist manner and department. Worship gods and spirits of the heavens and earth. He's calling everybody hypocrites, including himself. But he says the one means the one way we have out of this hypocrisy and out of this deceitful. And this is to just say the name of AMI to Buddha. And that's the nimbly to practice. That's what's being shown in this sculpture. Another version of sort of discussing, you know, what this is about comes from around the same time again, as this sculpture is made. This particular text is dated to 1212 and it's by another monk who believes in Buddhism. And that Mung Conan is describing the moods of practice as such. He says, The method of final salvation that i, uh, propounded is neither a sort of meditation such as practiced by many scholars in China and Japan, nor is it a repetition of the Buddha's name by those who have studied and understood its deep meaning. It's nothing but the mere repetition of the nominal army to boot, sir, without a doubt, of His mercy, whereby one can be born into the land of perfect bliss. So he's saying you don't have to be highly educated. Don't have to repeat the name in a sense of somebody who's deeply studied it right through these complicated practices such as esoteric Buddhism. All you have to do is say this prayer without doubt, and you can move into paradise. You continuous. The mere repetition with firm faith includes all the practical details such as a threefold preparation of mind. The four practical rules. If I, as an individual had any doctrine more profound than this, I should miss the mercy of the two honorable ones, Almeida, the Buddha of Paradise and Shaka, which is the Buddha in real life. And be left out of the vowel bombing a Buddha. Those who believe this clearly understand all the teachings of Shaka that Chaka taught throughout his whole life should behave themselves like simple-minded folk who know not a single letter or ignorant nuns and monks whose faith is implicitly simple. Thus without pedantic errors, they should fervently practice the repetition of the name of Alameda and that alone, pedantic heirs being without the kind of necessary teachings. So again, in this text, what we're getting is the idea that Buddhism has been reduced to really the simplest possible method. Proclaiming Your faith and being able to qualify therefore, to move out of the realm of rebirth, the physical realm into, the Buddhists happened into Pure Land. And that's saying this prayer. Praise be to ometer put x2 or to AMI to Buddha. And this was the central practice of AMI to Buddhism, of Pure Land Buddhism which became extremely, extremely popular in this time because it was so simple, because it was so accessible. Because as Honan describes, you don't need to be highly educated. You don't need to study with a monk. You don't need to be a monk or nun to gain salvation. You to save this prayer with faith. And the simplification of Buddhist prayer. We associate the kind of move toward that mass spectrum or mass appeal Buddhism with another idea that was popular at this time. The idea that in the cycle, the larger cycles of history, what was happening was the world was entering into an age of decline. Of the Buddhist law. That is, the understanding and faith of Buddhism was declining in the world. And that word for that age of decline of called mop pole. There are three basic large cycles to the kind of Buddhist concept of history. You have an age of the ideas that are coming into the world. Sort of budding of Buddhism, who have a golden age where people practice Buddhism and Buddhist ideals are seen throughout the world. And then you have an age of decline where everything kind of goes to hell. And then you begin a new phase of the Buddhist cycle. After that phase of everything going to hell occurs, that age is going to hell as mop Hua, The Age of decline. And again, we're associating this practice of simplifying Buddhism down to its basic forms was trying to get more people to believe, trying to counteract the fact that everything is falling apart. And that's where a man toga and comes in. That's exactly what he's doing here. He's practicing nimbly to prayer. And again, as you all discuss this as a realist sculpture that conveys just this basic simple practice as a mode of salvation, as a mode of moving into the Pure Land. We'll get more detailed into who token is in a minute. But let's look at some broader historical structure here to think about why it is people thought they were in an age of decline? Or is the simple answer. At the end of the Han period, there was a massive civil war. Cough again, pay wars that lasted for about five years from 1011821185. So a little over a 100 years after our lady morris, OK, he's at court writing down all of these juicy details. And we can see that the conflict in the war is instigated by these aristocratic Lawrence that we talked about last class and the power of these strong families who are trying to place one another in positions of power. The heads of each of these families are called Dimeo. And they're the ones who triggered this war. Again, pay for because each of them is trying to claim, or several of them are trying to claim that their son is right, has a right to claim the throne. And this begins in the ten fifties when the emperor dies quite young without an heir. And because all of these families, his aristocratic families or inter-married with one another, each of them claims a kind of right to the throne. And three major clans in particular are all fighting at the end of the 11th and then the beginning of an end through the middle of the 12th century for power at court, the Fujiwara clan, tire a clan and amino motel clam. At the end of again pay war after all of these clans of thought with one another and laid to waste each other's army is, it's the amino moto clan that comes out victorious. And this is a transition in the way in which power is structured in Japan. So the Emperor is left as the figurative Head of State, but more or less neutered or deprived of all of the military, political, and economic role it's at the Emperor once had. Those are taken now by the head of the mena moto Klan at this time who establishes a new role in government called the Shogun. Shogun literally translates to general. So army generals were called children as well. But the Shogun in-charge of Japan is a singular position. And the Emperor, although he is supposed to be sharing power with the Shogun, the emperor is mainly maintained as a kind of honorific role. He pays homage to ancestors. He maintains certain kinds of rituals, but the practical rule of Japan is now in the hands the Shogun. And this structure with the Shogun in power and the emperor as a kind of figure head loss all the way till the 19th century. So it's a major transition in the way Japan's governed. At this time with the rise of this position of the general right, this militarize name associated with him, Shogun, general. Cms arise in power of the summer I had class as well. Until the 12th century, Samurai had mainly been considered mercenary warriors. They were brought on by various families to fight in these battles. They were trained where class, but with the elevation of the Shogun. So can the elevation of this class of people, if a mercenary class becomes kind of landed with power, with money and with class. Summarize. In the period, again that we're talking about. The Common Core, a period in which you have the Shogun and charged amino moto. Clan Shogun in charge. The capital moves to come a Quora, a city on the coast that was the seat of the mena moto clan. And then he moved from the Han period. Remember the hay on capital was in pay on Q, which is the name of that point for Kyoto. And again, our regime shifts are often signaled in Japan by these title shifts that have to do with where the capital is. So from hay on, which is Kyoto, two comma Cora, Common Core period and the major shift again there being the structural shift of having the Shogun and charge. This has a militarized regime and its messy as dirty and its mean. Partly because of all of the aftermath of the Civil War. The successions. Of the emperor and the Shogun are marked by all sorts of different kinds of murder. It's high drama at courts. And among the Sjogren's brothers are killing each other, people are killing children, people are killing their in-laws. And it's again, high drama soap opera. But the key thing is that the power now is split between the Shogun and the emperor and also between the church, the Buddhist church. Unlike the shift that happens with Neo-Confucianism in China, is still highly involved in state politics. So this is the moment, this is the kind of confusion of dirty politics, militarization, Civil War that we get the rise and broadening of AMI to Buddhism in particular, in the sense that things are in a period of decline. So that brings in our Guy show toga and this is important for you to remember. These names sound quite similar to you when they're written in Japanese, they're clearly different. But toga and is a specific historical person. This guy counting off as beads, the Shogun with an S, perhaps as generalized position that's established at this time. So who is told him he was born right in the middle of the civil wars into an elite family. One of the, one of these sort of landed aristocratic families. But in all likelihood he was not the primary sun. We can guess that because of the fact that he became a monk, primary sons were usually married into the court somehow or some way or made retainers to Princes, as we discussed with Lady Morris Zaki. So he's first train as a Buddhist monk in the esoteric styles of Buddhism. Remember our discussion of Mondelez, right? These geometric complicated ways of visualizing relationships that can sometimes last days, these liturgical processes of relating to the Buddha. But he switches, he switches to AMI, to Buddhism later. So you didn't have to maintain one sect over another over your lifetime as a monk, you could switch has children did. During the Civil War. A major temple complex called TO DIG was destroyed. And the emperor during the beginning of the Common Core up period, who again, has certain kinds of roles, but is more of a figurehead, assigns to engage his network of funds and money and relationships to help rebuild the temple. To DIG was central to Buddhist practice, was very early temple and it was associated with the rulers and emperors of past Japan as well. And so the person he chooses to be in charge of gathering all this funds together and picking the different artisans to reconstruct this temple which was damaged and more was our guy here, children. And that's one of the reasons why he becomes historically important. He goes around first by fundraising through the various aristocratic families. One of the ways and by what she can do that is because he himself is from an aristocratic family. He has these connections that are interpersonal, that allows him to ask for money on behalf the Buddhist church. Another thing that's interesting about this process is that he actually goes to to gather metallurgists, people who are skilled at manipulating casting technique and metal in order to help him to recreate the large Buddha sculpture that had been damaged there. So this connection between China and Japan has not loss, particularly through Buddhism. Chosen as someone in charge of all the rituals that help to enliven the repaired form of the Buddha ceremony which is finalized by the emperor painting on the eyes. At the end of the Civil War in 1185. Painting on the eyes of figures as the last step toward connecting the image of the Buddha to the Buddha itself. And this rebuilding of towed IG is not just an, an imperial practices such as the Emperor that's part of this. The Shogun also contributes money to this. So all of these major factors are part of the sort of core cultural production in Japan at this time. The Shogun, the emperor and feed church, which you might think of through the actions of someone like children. And many of the things we know about him are actually not just due to the fact that we have this beautiful portrait sculpture of him, but because it has wrecked, the record of his deeds are recorded in 12 or three around the same time as this sculpture was, was made. And the record of his deeds are mostly about all the good things he did for Buddha's Buddhism as a religion. And here's that temple in nano Japan TO DIG. And here's an image of that die boots. And you can get a sense for scale by looking at these tourists here in relation to this Buddha. At this time, this was the largest metal sculpture in the world. The largest cast metal sculpture in the world. And it was destroyed, as I said in the beginning of these civil wars. And children as the guy who was tasked with rebuilding not only the Buddha, but also the temple. This temple burned down again later on in the early modern period. And so this is a much later version, but it gives you an idea for what it was the Shogun is most famous for. Now when it comes to the image itself as you described, it's very realistic. That realism is due to the fact that innovations in sculpting, especially would sculpting at this time were geared toward creating images that felt more like real limited, felt more like people in the world. And this is a prime example of that kind of. Move income a core, a period sculpture toward realism. One of the innovations is the use of assembled woodblock construction to create wood sculpture. Any of you who have ever carved in wood before or worked with would before, may know that. One of the difficulties of working with a solid piece of wood is that would drive slowly over time from outside to in as it dries. If it's a solid piece of wood, what will happen is you'll get shifts and cracks as the cells of the wood fiber dry out and shrink and contract around one another. So if you have a solid piece of wood sculpture, you carved out of fresh wood, chances are within a decade or two, or certainly within a 100 years. The whole thing is going to develop cracks that will form naturally through the further drying out of the wood. In order to avoid that assembled woodblock construction is, is used so that you can have a kind of longevity of the objects. But it also allows you to think of the object in kind of more, more sculptural terms that are, that are about additive forms rather than subtractive forms. So as you can see in this diagram, you take different sections of words that have all been dried separately so that they don't, they won't crack. And you combine them to gather with adhesive so that you get the basic outer form of the thing you want and then you carve away at it. And then you leave the inside hollow as well so that the air can circulate there and dry out the word as well. And woodblock assembled woodblock cuts construction technique. Once that outer would form or once the inner would form is carves. You then wrap the whole thing in fabric and in clay that allows you to further get a subtlety of contouring detail, like with the detail that you see in these folds. That new lacquer, all of that hemp fabric with the, with the clay that's used to get this level of detail with the wrinkles in the fabricating the face so that the whole thing becomes waterproof. Remember we talked about lacquer with them are key zone. It is a kind of material that comes from the sap of trees and which solidifies on contact with their, you can think of it almost like an early plastic or coding substance that seals off forms from aging, from contact with water, et cetera. And all the combination of these techniques in this new style of assembled woodblock construction or geared around creating more realistic sculptures. And we see a plethora of, of a lot of really, really realistic sculptures in this time. So much so that when you say comma core, a period sculpture, you associated. Hi mode of realism. So the style and the technique again is designed to make it look like the sculpture as almost like a living person through these various carving lacquer ring and even the use of, of actual fabric and clay to create all of these drapes unfolds. And we associate that partly with the fact that images with Amit of Buddhism should be doing the same sort of work as the inputs to prayer. They should be making Buddhism as simple as possible so that anybody can practice it and anybody can understand. You don't need to be highly educated to get what Buddhism is about to get into the Pure Land as our excerpts, as our readings showed us. And the images themselves are not highly complicated either. They look like real people. They're doing the things that count. In Buddhism, like knocking off a prayer, read everytime you say, Now Muhammad a boot, sir. Unless we associate with the attempt to kind of mass appeal of ometer Buddhism. And you can also begin to associate it with this shift in political regimes. So whereas our former aristocratic families were talking to each other at court through these fuzzy poems. Many of which were written in Chinese are, are ruling class now are more militarized, right? And the kinds of images and thoughts and ideas that they want are going to be a little bit more direct in the sense that a militarist mode of education is different than a literary mode of education that defined aristocratic society and continue to define more aristocratic society. So again, we think of the directness of realist imagery and associated with the mass appeal of Buddhism at this time through AMI to Buddhism and this military, military patronage that's happening across the arts with people like the Shogun on the samurai coming into power. I'll get your questions in a minute once we wrap this up and I kind of lose my train of chatter here. So other examples of this kind of realism and sculpture, we might compare our Chaka triad, right? Our earliest Buddhist sculpture that we looked at in Japan. With this sculpture. This isn't sculpture from a chemical or a period at the same time as our sculpture of the token. And it is an image of the prints show tofu, same prints for whom this image was commissioned in 622623. By the time of the Common Core period print show, Tokyo had almost gained a kind of saintly reputation and people worshipped at shrines devoted to the Printz because he helped to bring Buddhism to Japan. This particular sculpture of the infant at the age of two shows just how intelligent print show Tokyo was as a child right? Standing up and saying the prayer. And again, it's in this highly realistic forum of sculpture that comes into maturity during a Common Core a period. Even the eyes in this are made with rock crystal that is transparent, stone that looks like. Real eyes with painted backgrounds so that it looks like pupils. The light would catch them and reflect on them, enlivening the sculpture even more fully. Here's another example of one of the monks credited with really bringing AMI to Buddhism and nimble to practice to the four. This monk Cooja lived during the hay on period. But this sculpture was made at the same time as our sculpture was made. And you can see and even increased effort at making that nimbly to practice visualized. And it's sort of fantastical realist form. Here you have the monk saying the chance and each time he chance the name admin boots. So rather than counting off a bead, a little Buddha, a little Amit, a Buddha comes out of his mouth into the world as if he's realizing it. And monks like Cooja traveled around from town to town, banging bonds and chanting. And this is one of the chance associated with his name. Or two of them. He never fails to reach the lotus land of Bliss who calls, if only once, the name of Almeida. Again, I'll meet a Buddhist prayer is all that it takes to get tab and the second one reiterate similarly, a far, far distant land is paradise. I've heard them say. But those who want to go can reach there in just today. How do you do that? We practice nimble. It's just that Kui hours practicing here again, looking at the sculpture, you can directly understand that this person is chanting the name of Buddha while banging a gong. And that is one of the effects of the surrealist sculpture. To convey the ideas of AMI to Buddhism. Means look at your chats to see if anything has come up. Why does Buddhism go into decline? Again, it's, it's less the fact that put isn't became less popular. It's up that sense up to clients in a sense, Mapo is that sense that the world around you is crumbling and that people are becoming meaner, nastier. And living the principles of Buddhism lasts. You might get more people practicing Buddhism. But the sense is that the world has cognitive tripped into the state of Minas and deplorable or disturbing activity in which people are not acting along the precepts of Buddhism that was named by people at this time. And the Civil War was a yet another sign of fat. And yes, the Sjogren's contribution to rebuilding helped to show his legitimacy, right? And help to show the unification of Japan in the promotion of Buddhism. And the Shogun was warring against the emperor to gain power. I don't know about worrying. If this FS times so much as they are competing with one another through court politics. We'll get into that, I think a little bit later As, as well in terms of the transition to the next period of Japanese history in which the emperor breaks off from this Shogun rule and tries to rule the South of Japan by himself. So let's move to our next image and talk about some of the things that she began comparing, right? You said this is a different kind of image. This is a painting and we're meant to interact with it differently. It's not the kind of realist sculpture that demonstrates very physically what we're supposed to do to practice AMI to stop Buddhism. When we associate this sculpture or this painting with Zen or Chan Buddhism as it's known in Chinese. And much is obvious to any Buddhist practitioner, both for the iconography of the image. Bodhidharma owner read, and also to anybody who was literate. And again, this requires another stage of education that AMI to Buddhist practice does not. Because you could read this inscription that says Crossing rivers and deserts, he came, he being Bodhidharma, facing the emperor. He said, I don't know. Unsuccessful. He moved on his feet treading on the water. So this poem, as you know, is a reference to the Bohr extended story of Bodhidharma, who travels from in India to China. Because he thinks to himself one day, as I think of China, I know among the great humanity of that country there are great many potential followers of my teaching. So I know this is talking about China. That's where Bodhidharma first travels. And we're encountering this image in Japan. So there's a slight layer of complication there, but just, let's follow the story far or just a minute. And remember that at this time, Song Dynasty or earth is time, which is during sort of Six Dynasties Period of China that, that Bodhidharma is traveling. But China is broken up and all sorts of smaller regions of role. So he says there's a great many potential followers of my teaching there. So he travels as a monk to go spread the ideas of Buddhism. And he sails across the ocean and he went through the desert seeking manhood, hear him discuss the Buddhists law. When he reached China, he had an audience with the Emperor Wu of the state of Liang. This is one of those smaller kingdoms and the Six Dynasties Period. And Emperor Wu of the state-of-the-art asks him, What does the ultimate meaning of the sacred teaching of Buddhism? And the master reply as vast and nothing is sacred. Then the emperor as well. Who are you to confront me with this? He says this is kind of a junk answer. That's not what I asked. He says, who are you to talk to me this way. And Bodhidharma says, I don't know, I don't know who I am. And the emperor didn't understand these sorts of phrases which are illogical, right? He's not answering the question directly. And so Bodhidharma things while he doesn't understand the kind of Buddhism that I'm practicing. So I'm going to find somebody who does it breaks off or read. And he puts it down on the Yangzi River, which is a massive river in China. And he floats on it to the monastery, Shaolin Temple, and he stays there for nine years meditating. Staring at a wall. And then during that time in the deep snow, he's visited by his first disciple, a man named Quaker, who was called the second patriarch of Zen Buddhism, Bodhidharma being the first patriarch. And so this painting illustrates that story of going to find somebody out in the world who understands. The idea is that you want to bring to the world of Buddhism. And so we can think of this as the beginning of the lineage. And Zen Buddhism is very lineage base which differentiates it from me to Buddhism. The beginning of a lineage of the practice of Zen or Chan Buddhism. When Bodhi Dharma brings his ideas about Buddhism to China and then finds his first disciple named Quaker, not Emperor Wu, who just doesn't get what he's talking about. So again, this is the beginning of a lineage of Zen patriarchs, but we have to drop Bodhidharma teachings all the way back to the ideas of the Buddha so that we can understand what it is that Zen Buddhism is actually about. So Bodhidharma it begins to teach and practice and preach a mode of Buddhism that is based on a particular interaction between the Buddha and one of the Buddha's followers called Mahasi kappa. So in the Buddha's, After the Buddha reaches a sense of enlightenment and is preaching in the world and before he dies and reaches Nirvana, exiting the cycle of rebirth and moving into paradise. He teaches his various disciples to go on to continue his work. And the world's One of those whose name has kappa and the story of the origins of Zen Buddhism go that one day the Buddha was seated amongst all of his disciples. And he calls them all to a meeting to talk about his ideas. But he sits there and he doesn't speak. It just maintains silence and he holds up a flower. That's the sermon, no speech. Just holding up a flower. Immediately. Many of the other disciples start to discuss with one another. Well, what does this mean? And they started debate all the different ideas about Buddhism and embodiment and whatever. And yadda, yadda, yadda. And they get into these sort of loud debates for the Buddha is just sitting there with his flower. Only one of the disciples are only one of the disciples. So the story goes, minus kappa doesn't talk to anybody else and he just sits there and smiles. The Buddha says, mass gap as the one that's understood what the sermon is about. And the basic understanding there is that not all things can be understood through simple discussion or words or through the conveyance of, of a kind of spoken sermon. Some realizations have to happen internally and happen kind of instantaneously. At the understanding of why it was that the Buddha was not speaking in just holding the flour. And these moments of kind of epiphany are important to Zen Buddhism in particular. And this idea of drawing a lineage, Bodhidharma as drawing a lineage back to US. Gaap. And Buddha, I love finding somebody who understands you. Understands you even when you're not speaking and can get what it is that you're referencing this idea of a kind of teacher and the disciple relationship, which is one of your key terms, is the backbone of Zen practice. And in order to be a Zen Buddhist monk, you have to have a teacher and that teacher can usually draw their lineage all the way back to this initial lineage where Bodhidharma fines Quaker. And that's what the poem is about. Him going to find somebody who understands him, like minus kappa, understood the Buddha. And that lineage. It's passed on where teachers have the kind of true lineage of Zen Buddhist practice that goes all the way back to Bodhidharma. There's a moment in the Tang dynasty where Zen Buddhist practice splits into various forms. And each of them draws their lineage back through a different line of teachers. But the important thing here is that you need to define who your teacher is and how that connects you all the way back to the Buddha. And to think about again, this lineage of, of, of ideas that brings you all the way back to the original Buddha as one way of thinking about how you teach and go about Buddhist practice. And whereas many of the things that we've looked at before told the different stories of the Buddha or connect to the Buddha's body and a variety of ways. This particular lineage focused form of Buddhism is structured around these conversations that happened between you and your teacher. And so it's a very rarefied form. In order to be a Zen monk, you have to give up your life entirely. It's almost the opposite of AMI to Buddhism. And you have to devote yourself to Buddhists practice. And through this idea of a transmission of, of Buddhist knowledge from teacher to disciple, and often through non-textual means. So you can just read about the Buddha. You have to have these sorts of epiphanies like mosque gap and the Buddha had. And there are these kind of two basic paths within Zen or Chan Buddhism to enlightenment. You can have a sudden realization or you can gradually become enlightened, usually through repetitive labor, like sweeping the same walkway every single day. When it comes to the first mode, the kind of Sudden enlightenment mode. The key types of ideas to that are nestled in stories that are discussed between teacher and the Sappho. Called Cohen's, literally just means the US case or case study. That leads you to one of these breaks with an understanding of the world as fixed and leads you to enlightenment. Recon, as Bodhidharma supposed to have said, as a special transmission that's outside of scriptures, right? You don't read it. Doesn't rely on words or letters. But it points directly to ideas about Buddha nature that are in, in the mind. And usually they're paradoxes. And the way a paradox works is that there's a contradiction somehow in the logic of the sentence. And therefore, they break your mode of rational thinking, of rational reasoning. Or sometimes they are just meant to flout. Politeness is right to move against the sorts of things that embarrass you into therefor break your reliance on polite behavior or the normative behavior of the worlds. Many of you have probably heard of Cohen and maybe you didn't know it. So what is the sound of one hand clapping As a famous Cohen? And part of what this colon helps you to think about is, well, what if I have one hand? I guess I can sort of try and clap it to itself, but clapping is with two hands. So the logic of the question defeats any actual physical relationship. How can I get two hands clapping? It leads you to a certain line of reasoning. That is the bargain. Undoing your attachment to language is the thing that guide you through an understanding of the world. So rather than two hands clapping, he realized that the world is not broken into two things that might intersect with one another, right? Subject an object. Instead, it's all connected through one body. If this hand is connected to this hand, the world isn't broken into things that you relate to that subject and object. It's all interconnected. That's one way of understanding this paradoxical phrase. Another one that flouts this idea of an earlier ideas about Buddhism that are associated with the body as if you meet the Buddha, kill him. But it's very sort of sacrilegious to certain ideas about the sacred nature, nature of the Buddha's body. And this leads to again, thinking about ideas about non-attachment and of the true body of the Buddha not really being the physical body. So if you're seeing somebody that's claiming to be the Buddha need to annihilate that idea that's not the Buddha. The Buddha is out there in all of the phenomena of the world. Which relates again back to our idea of the true body of the Buddha from the Mandela that we discussed in the Tang Dynasty. So this idea of handing down from teacher to disciple and sort of spreading the ideas of Buddhism from one person to another finds its way into Japan in and around the 12th century. And part of the reason that this is the moment where you really get this influx is because there are a lot of monks traveling from the northern part of China that are fleeing the invasion that's happened there. Remember we talked about the Northern Song Dynasty and the Southern Song. That's all part of the Song dynasty. But that certainly has he lost its northern territories in 1126 under Emperor who aids on. And a lot of the people fleeing that invasion from the north travelled to Japan, especially monks, where they went to go and try and preach their particular brand of Zen Buddhism. And that's why this particular painting, although depicts a monk. It travels from India to China in the Six Dynasties Period and is inscribed with a poem. And the poem is written in Chinese. And it's about Bodhidharma finding his first Chinese decide for. This is actually a Japanese painting. It's painted in Japan or Japanese audiences. It's inscribed by a monk named E shining, a Chinese Zen missionary who travelled to Japan to spread these ideas and lived in Japan as a monk. The painting is also painted by a Chinese painter named Lee helpful, who's active in and around 1300. We have various dated records of his painting, other things around that time. But we know that Liao Fu, whose name is only recorded in Japanese sources. Which again leads us to understand that this Chinese immigrant to Japan was there to help spread the ideas of Buddhism this time through painting. And so these, the painter and the monk who inscribe it, they're both Chinese but they're living in Japan. Painting for a Japanese audience to help spread Zen Buddhism fair. Now, San arrives again in the late 12th century to Japan and its almost immediately seized upon by the emperor. Remember that we talked about how the Buddhist church and the imperial family and the Shogun. They're all quite interconnected in terms of the sources of power in Japan at this time than sources of influence. One of the emperors of the Common Core a period. Remember he's been sort of demoted in a way, right? In terms of how it is he can rule. I only really rules in name. Really takes to Zen Buddhism any helps to establish a large network of Buddhist temples in Japan, over 300 Zen monasteries. And the income from these monasteries goes in part to the emperor, goes in parts to the Shogun as well. But the monks are in charge of MIT, of managing these territories that are sometimes on rural estates. And Emperor go Diego is constantly trying to get new ideas about architecture, get new ideas about Zen, Buddhism and arts from China. And so there's a connection that he's making with China at this time as well. Introducing new Chinese culture through the establishment of the Zen monasteries among other practices. Now the Emperor go Diigo is somebody who, although born into this system where the Shogun has all the power, tries to revive the power of the emperor. And he tries to overthrow the Shogun. Shogun it and tries to have him assassinated. It doesn't work. And so emperor go Diigo flees south. And this leads to a period of split rule in the North and the South called the Mura mushy period in Japan. And so again, politics here between the Shogun and the emperor and with the church acting almost as a kind of in-between space. Is sort of central to understanding how it is that these various objects get commissioned and how Zen Buddhism becomes very important to political movements like empirical Diego's revival of the power of the emperor. He used the monasteries as a kind of network in order to stage his rebellion. Now lest you think that this is simply emperor go Diigo sponsoring Zen Buddhism. There's also lots of evidence of Zen Buddhism was highly favored among the Shogun and the samurai as well. So you can't just associated with one class or another. And some of the reasons that Zen Buddhism appeal to this warrior classes because it was action oriented, right? If you were into the slow and gradual enlightenment mode of thinking about Zen Buddhism, it was about the repetitious action for an extended period of time over days like military training for instance. It was process-oriented, was also non-textual, right? As we discussed earlier, it was about immediate bodily understanding of the ideas of non-attachment are the sort of connectivity of all things in the world. And it was about discipline, and it was about concentration. It was about mentor-ship and individual kinds of relationships between teachers and disciples. All things that have a mirror in the militarize training world. So for instance, this painting I've done for the Shogun during the Mura marshy period is about a, it is the illustration of a Zen Koan of trying to catch catfish with a cord, right where your tool doesn't seem to fit. A job prime. And inscribed on this painting, as you see below, are over 20 different inscriptions by not only monks, but also aristocrats. And summer I and the Shogun, him himself, who all wrote poems in relationship or in response to this co on. So it's a very inter woven set of obligations that Zen Buddhists sort of had to court and to the Sjogren's at this time as well. But the principles that separate something like this image and our image of the among children are drastically different in terms of how you engage with Buddhism. Lastly, I want to come to this idea that you all, that many of you pointed to in your description that you can barely see this figure. The figure seems to disappear into the painting and that's intentional. It's not just because the images old. The figure is outlined with these strokes of very light gray to delineate the body under the robes right? Places of the highest concentration of ink, which are the last to be added. Or at the feet where he touches the. Read. And if the eye is right, which are the kind of point of engagement for any viewer viewing a figure painting. You go to the eye as almost immediately and first with a ghost-like forms that disappear into the image, especially if they're lit by candle light. Again, helped to reinforce some of these ideas about the impermanence of form and a non-duality that are relatively consistent across and figure painting style is ghost-like images so much stand in contrast to these hard outline images that we see in the Goldman's painting or in the painting, the anonymous painting of the tail Kenji. So the style helps to reinforce the concept as well. So again, we can associate these vocabulary words at each of these different Buddhist practices and these images that are meant to reinforce on the image on the right lineage. This is Bodhidharma finding his disciple, that teacher, disciple relationship. The edges of koans, these complicated paradoxical phrases that break your relationship with the world, just as Bodhidharma ought not to be floating on just a single read. And these ideas of enlightenment right, of, of, of using things like nonsense as Bodhidharma first use when you talk to Emperor Wu. Break your understanding and reliance on language to understand the world. And then you have here that sort of simplified practice of numbered unnumbered sir nanometer boot sir as the core tenant of AMI to Buddhist practice and the realism that goes along with that we associate with assembled what block construction. And let me think about the again, relation to the social, governmental, and religious changes of the Common Core period. We have to think of someone like Shogun being so honored with such a sculpture because she was responsible for rebuilding this major Temple. And that the shift that happens in his lifetime that causes this temple to be destroyed are all about the politics of this new Shogun. At the Shogun being in charge is Dimeo who are warring with one another for control that caused again pay war, which put Shogun a toga and in this position to have to perform these tasks. And then when we think about the politics of this particular painting, we think about the movement of ideas from China during the 12th century and the use of Zen Buddhism and Buddhist churches by the Emperor to try and overthrow the Shogun it. So court politics in church politics still extremely intertwined. And that brings us to the end with just a minute to bear. Where did Bodhidharma come from? I forget the words and story there about who is Persian or Indian? That's a good question. You might have to go look that detail up. Or he comes from outside of China though. And one of the reasons why we know that is that he's portrayed as a foreigner with a beard, with an earring and with hairy feet. Attributes that are normally associated with outsiders, especially when Buddhist imagery. Any other questions you want to talk about before we end the class today? Alright, well, take care everybody. And I hope you have a good weekend beginning the inability to Mara anyway, take care. Thank you, professor.




## [10. The Mongolian Empire](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/10-the-mongolian-empire?module_item_id=2446438)
 Ooh, Mm-hm. Alright, let's go ahead and get started now. And we'll just let people trickle in as the world seems like low attendance for whatever reason. Starting off class today. First thing is your essays. Just to update you on those, I began grading them alongside your peer reviews, so do them all at once to make it easier. And I'm going to respond to the whole class with an announcement that sort of lays out common mistakes in the essay. But with 300 students all writing this essay, I can't afford to give each of you individual feedback in this first round, if you'd like more feedback from the about your writing, you can feel free to come to my office hours, which as always are before this. And afterwards I'm always just sitting here with WebEx on doing work. So you're welcome to come talk to me at those moments or P of classes, then schedule some other time with me to come and talk about. You're writing if it's something you want to improve upon. I am also seriously considering reducing the number of writing assignments from three to two because it takes me so long to move through them and correct them. I think I will probably be reducing it to two writing assignments. Just FYI, so keep an eye out for that announcement if you have strong feelings about that. In terms of advocating for keeping it at three, you can feel free to email me. Are there any questions about all of that so far? Okay. Then let's move on to today's class. This is the second to last class for this segment on what we're generally call in the medieval period. And we're dealing with the Mongolian empire at this point. Many of you probably will, probably will have heard of this. The Mongolian empire or maybe even set it a little bit in a world history segment in high school. It was a pretty fascinating moment in world history when in the early 13th century, this nomadic group of people, people who aren't marked by some of the traditional Western standards of civilization. Large cities, et cetera. Nomadic people conquer much of the known world, including eventually China, Korea. There's an attempt to go and conquer Japan as well. Parts of the northern sort of most section of South Asia and Southeast Asia, Central Asia, all the way through in two and up to Constantinople. Reads from Mongolia in invaders happened at the outskirts of Poland and Germany. And so the expanse of the Mongolian Empire at its height was really unrivaled anywhere in the world, in world history in terms of the geographic area that was conquered and ruled over by the Mongolians. The breadth of this empire wasn't maintained fully under one administration for the extent of, of its rulership, I guess is the word I'm looking for. Whereas most of you've heard of Genghis or Genghis Khan, the person who started off this empire. It was really his successors, his sons and grandsons, who expanded the empire to its fullest extent and then of course, fought over who got to rule that empire. And when it came to the fifth of the so-called Kagan's, The King of Kings and Genghis Khan is the first. There was a civil war in the late 13th century. So we're talking, you know. Really a period of about 50 or 60 years with this empires expanding and then breaks up again. And by the time of the late 13th century, what had been the larger, largest expanse of the Mongol bungling empire was really divided into four major comments or regions of rule by the Mongolians. And the one that we're talking about is the one that has to do with East Asia, marked here on the map of that divide the Mongolian empire in orange. And the name given to that dynasty that was established by the Mongolians was the Yuen dynasty. And as you can see from the dates that lasts around a 100 years. And the ruler of this easternmost portion and end of what was the origin point of Mongolians monk Mongolia. The steps regions of Mongolia had the title, the official title of the Great Khan or the King of Kings, the comment. But again, at this point, during the rule over China that we're talking about, there was not a unified rule over all of the expanse of the Mongolian empire, even though the ruler of the eastern most portion of the empire officially was given the title king over all of the other kings. These were overruled somewhat separately by the extended family of Genghis Khan and the person who rules over what we think of as China now and of Korea. And who attempts to invade Japan is Kubla Khan, and he was one of the grandsons of Genghis Khan. And when he establishes a dynastic name, part of what he's doing in China is acknowledging previous modes of rulership. Taking on Chinese emperor. I'm Chinese emperor, name emperor scherzo and establishing a court in the urban capital of what's now Beijing. But which was then called data. And again, all of these modes of thinking about rulership were very much different than the modes of rulership that we're sort of part of Mongolian politics and government. And the adaptation to the situation in China was part of the Mongolian mode of ruling. And that's really where two objects here come in. One of these objects, the tapestry was made for the Yuen dynasty court and for the Mongolian emperors. We'll talk about that. Second. And the first object made in 1295 as a painting made by a Chinese official who's serving the Mongolian courts for his friend Joe, me. So I want to start with that first object. Have forgiven you just really have roughshod version of what happens with the Mongolian Empire. And particularly with the kind of evidence that we're looking at. So we're looking at two different kinds of writing here which your excerpts, you're reading excerpt for today made relatively clear. I know there's a lot of confusing vocabulary words there, et cetera. But the kinds of writing that we're dealing with are the writings that go onto paintings, right? And this is something that we're not as familiar with. Those of us who come from a European and American perspective. The fact that you would write on a painting directly. So what sort of things are we finding? Right? We have the inscriptions right onto the painting itself by the painter. And that's the first of these pieces of writing that you encountered. And then I've given you a selection of some of the later colophons, these writings that are attached to the painting. And here's the full view that you can see it here. And I've shown you where on the painting each of these inscriptions exists. So the first inscription that we come across chronologically as write directly on the painting up in the sky, space or the space it sort of signifies as sky. And these other colophons he's later writings attachments that address the painting or describe it are follow one of them immediately here. Another one here, and another one here. And we're going to talk about sort of what kinds of information we can get from these inscriptions. So with that, I want you to discuss in the, in the chat board and respond to this prompt. These inscriptions and colophons there, each written at different times in history. And so what kinds of evidence are these? What do they give us for information and what story about the painting, the paintings origins or other things. Can you begin to piece together from all of these different inscriptions, from different moments in history. To take a moment, remind yourself of the inscriptions that are a little confusing perhaps. But try and garner sort of at least a general understanding of what sort of evidence. This isn't what story you can begin to piece together. I'll take a few minutes for you to respond and do that and then move on to looking at each of these inscriptions. Mm-hm. Okay. Ok. Um, hi. Alright. You guys are all hitting it sort of on the head in terms of what an inscription or a Colophon is, as many of you have, have said. They'll just pick out a few names here to throw some bones here. But I'm going to have everybody basically saying Ethan, Lauren, Eric, Daria, ban anion in none. Sorry. All of you are talking again about how this, these colophons, what's interesting about them and inscriptions is that they describe the kind of context first in which something is made, especially the inscription because that's by the person who painted it. Dedicating the painting to a particular memory and a particular person. And we'll get into those details first will go through a little bit more of a fine-toothed comb. But generally you guys are correct. It gives us sort of context for the painting. And then what you get added onto it later are all these different moments in time where people react to it. I think is Eric had said it sometimes is about your personal relationship with the landscape and then you compare it to the painting itself. Sometimes it's about your personal relationship with painting history. As we'll look at some of the particular inscriptions. And what they offer. And will be interesting to see is as we move through each of the inscriptions, excuse me, and colophons, we'll notice that different respondents, different people viewing the painting, prioritize different sorts of information. Some of them are very interested in the biography of the painter. Some of them are very interested in the relationship between the painter and the person you gave it to his patron, Joe me. Some of them are very interested in the geography of what you're seeing here in the image itself because it is a specific place, despite the fact that it's painted in what we might think of as a somewhat stylized way. And we'll talk about that stylization as well. So you're getting quite a variety of different information here. One thing that cherry to draw our attention to is the fact that you're actually getting a variety of different inscription styles are getting different kinds of calligraphy because the span of time over which these inscriptions is happening has hundreds of years. And just pause a moment and think about how strange that isn't, how different it is. And many other art forms, especially painted art forms. In the fact that a lot of Chinese paintings like this do carry lots of colophons and inscriptions that give you what we might call a kind of reception history. A history of the way that people felt when looking at this exact thing and how different it is, again, from our own perceptions of what's acceptable. In a sense that you can write directly on the painting and inscribe it with your calligraphy. You know, your artful arrangement of words and ideas, sometimes with poems. And that, that it, that is considered a kind of an addition to the painting. Not that your defacing it, but that you're adding more to it through that response. And if you remember, when we looked at landscape painting theory back with Cauchy and course, there was this discussion of the fact that the arts painting and the arts of calligraphy share the brush in Common Core. She said this and gloss course. And then you have again this sort of gentlemanly arts of literati painting that develop in the Song Dynasty that correlate the ideas of again, writing and poetry and Gentleman the arts with painting of, of all media. And so this is within that kind of realm of literati, gentlemanly painting that you begin to inscribe the ways you react to things, your feelings and other poems on, on the painting itself. And again, within world cultures, this is a, quite a, uh, maybe not unique, but a relatively rare sort of, sort of a thing that the object, the object itself carries its history with it. So if we go to our first inscription that we get chronologically, this is the inscription from which we get the date of the painting, 1295, because again, it's dated here, the bottom. Some of you will find the transcription of Chinese words a little strange. This is an older system as this sort of the most foremost study on this painting was done in the sixties, I think. And so I've, I've scanned the translations from that particular study and it uses a different kind of transcription of Chinese words called weighed Giles rather than the modern opinion version of transcribing Chinese words. But you'll just have to kind of bear with me and watch that some words like Gong Jin, This is actually GO and g, j, i. And in modern. In modern transcription. And similarly model Hua, You can make our HQA Mount Hall, but chow is CH apostrophe IA o within this kind of transcription mode. So I apologize for that confusion, but we can still move through what I think and basically get what's being talked about. So are painter is telling us what this painting is about in the first inscription to ever go on the painting, right? The one that's right here in the middle of the image. And a painter says, well, the venerable Gong Jin is a man of t that is of Shandong Province. So this guy Guan Jian is from Shandong Province. After I, the painter John wrongful completed my serves as a Dong Zhuo, which is an official title, sort of like a lieutenant governor. So a sort of second in command in province of CI job, which is a region of central, central Shandong. And I returned home. I told him that is I told Gong Jin about the mountains and rivers of key about the mountains and rivers of Shandong. So simplest here, simplest description of what's happening here. John Wong Fu is serving the Yuan Dynasty government. He's serving the Mongolians in Shandong Province. And when he returns home to Hangzhou where he lives, he tells his friend Gong Jin about Shandong Province. And remember Gong Jin is from Shandong Province. So I told him about the mountains and rivers of Qi of Shandong Province. Among them Mount Hoff who choose the most famous having been mentioned in the zone, drawn a book by choking of the late Zhou dynasty. Its shape as lofty and precipitous rise in isolated and the most unusual way. That's the pointy one. Until I painted this picture for him setting mouse chow on the East, which is why I call it autumn colors on the chow and hwa, the mountains. And the 12th month of the first year of the UN Geng era of the Yuan Dynasty, 1295 done by Zhao Meng full of whooshing, Which isn't Zhejiang Province, part of modern-day Hangzhou. So in this very simple short inscription, we get an explanation. Jiang Fu was serving as a government official in Shandong. His friend Joe me is from Shandong. When he returned back to judge on province in the south, he painted this and told his friend about this region, about, about Shandong Province. So why? If Joe me ish from Shandong Province, does he need his friend Geng Fu? Tell him about it. So the venerable Gong Jin, the person referred to in the inscription is, is his friend Joe me. That's his nickname. A lot of these scholars and officials had what we call pen names or sober katz. How is the Chinese word for it, or it's a secondary kind of a name, a literary name that they would use to sign off on inscriptions, calligraphy, paintings, etcetera. So when the painter Geng Fu was referring to Gong Jin, he's referring to his friend Joe me as a man of Shandong Province, Xiaomi was a famous collector and wealthy. Person in Hangzhou here in the South. And the reason why Joe me is labeled as a man from Shandong Province in the north. Bij amu is that the Joe family had once lived in Shandong Province and had very deep old roots there. And so Jammu, the painter is recognizing this and saying that. And I know that your family roots are way up north in Shandong Province and that in the 12th century before Xiaomi was ever born. So his grandfather's generation. But Joe family was forced to move south to Hangzhou during the transition from the north into the Southern Song. Remember how we talked about in the Song dynasty period that the last emperor of the Northern Song period lost the northern territory is Chinese invading non-Chinese dynasties. And that's when the Northern and Southern Song becomes split. And so fleeing that conquering army of the Jin, the Joe family was forced to move south and settle again in Hangzhou. So although join me as a man of key, a man of Shandong Province, according to John Wong Fu. In fact, Xiaomi had never been to or even seen Shandong Province with his own eyes. Which is one of the reasons why Geng Fu was painting this for him. But you might ask yourself, if China's reunified under the UN dime stay in North and South as it was. And how is it that Joe me has never been to Shandong Province. Why can't he go back to Shandong Province to see his ancestral home, which has family had to flee when it was, when the North was invaded by the Jin Dynasty. And that's because under Mongolian rule, people like Joe, me and Joe among four were treated differently than other folks. Within the bureaucratic system. Although Xiaomi came from a family of great wealth, he was not allowed to travel freely in Yuan Dynasty, China ruled by the Mongolians. And part of that was due to the fact that there was a class system put in place that was based on ethnic difference. Naturally at the top of the class system under Yuen dynasty, Mongolian rule of china. Where the Mongolians or people rolling under those came all of the Central Asians that had been incorporated into the Mongolian empire in the previous part of the century. Then under those the Jin Dynasty Chinese that had been incorporated next to last into this empire. And then lastly, those people who had been Chinese Members of the Song Dynasty, they were at the bottom of this new hierarchy, which is based on ethnicity, but also based off of when a group of people was conquered. So people last conquered or the people with the least amount of Mobility and trust within this four class system under Yuan Dynasty rule of China. And there were a group of other issues that the Mongolians had to deal with when they conquered all of these other lands. Again, the Mongolians were nomadic people. They were not agriculturally based. They did not build major cities. Instead, they moved with the seasons and with the grasslands to graze their animals. And when they conquered China as well as many of these other regions, they had to learn how to adapt to the system of rule in place there, enter the economies place there as well. China was an agrarian economy at base, meaning it was a farming economy, meaning stabilized villages and regions based around the production of staple goods. In especially the south, where the kind of bread basket of China is so to speak. Also, the area down here is not open plains. Easy, that it's easy for riding through, like the Mongolian plans that the Yuan Dynasty Mongols sort of grown up with. And so there's adaptation of policy and the adaptation of ways of ruling China. It had to do with the nature of the economy, in the nature of the people there as well. And you'll see that in many ways, the Mongolians adopted systems that were already exist. And in each of the places that they conquered, including again, as complicated system of Song Dynasty rule through agrarian sort of villages that built up into provinces, that built up into the total empire. And so they basically adopted the civil system of the Chinese and then just reorganized to was preferred in each of the kinds of levels of, of position. And the process of kind of adapting to the place that you are ruling and especially adapting to the cultures of China. We call signification becoming Chinese. And there are various arguments about how Chinese the Mongolians became in terms of how they adopted certain kinds of customs, certain kinds of rights to rule over China, to prove and to show that they were chinese enough to rule over the large Chinese population out there. And you can see within the emperor's name, right, emperor Kubla Khan takes the name scherzo. He names his dynasty as you would name a Chinese dynasty, the Yuan Dynasty. Official communications are happening in Mongolian and in Chinese. And there are all these efforts at showing a kind of Chinese cultural and political front to especially the Chinese that had been ousted from, from rule. And the old aristocratic families, aristocratic families like Xiaomi's family. But the snag is that you, again, for someone like Joe me and for someone like Jammu who are Chinese and at the bottom of this system of hierarchy, they saw their capacity to really be involved in government and to be engaged diminish quite heavily. And the question for them really was whether to serve at all. And Joe me decides not to serve. He becomes a kind of loyalist to the fallen Song dynasty. A leftover citizen as they often became described. And this mode of withdrawing from government service should sound familiar to you from our previous classes on China, whether it's legal and then trying to withdraw himself from court so as not to be caught up in court politics or Su, Sure, being cast out of court and acting kind of like a hermit. Or even all the way back to Wang CGIAR and others of the Six Dynasties Period in China, who again withdrew from public service as a way to kind of cultivate their own moral virtue. In this case, under the UN dynasty rule, many of these Chinese officials were demoted to the lower ranks of service and therefore decided it's better not to serve at all. It's better to maintain a kind of loyalty to the dynasty that I used to serve rather than to serve a dynasty that I don't believe in or which doesn't offer me much in terms of advancement. So Xiaomi takes on this era of being a loyalists and retreats into his wealthiest states and retires from service, so to speak. As the moral confusion thing to do, not to give up his loyalty to the people who used to serve. Whereas Zhao, among for the painter of this image, as we know from his inscription, decides to serve the Mongolians, he decides to become a government official. Even f is somewhat lower levels under the UN dynasty system, which adopted many of the basic traits, the civil service system that had been established before in the Song dynasty. And because John McPhee who decides to do this, he has more privileges than Joe me. The reason why Joni Can't traveled back to Shandong to see his ancestral homeland, which he's never seen before. Is that he as again the lowest ethics sort of rank. And this inverted pyramid now with the Mongolians on top, is not allowed to travel outside of his region unless he's on official government business. And because he's not a government official, he can't even pretend to do that. And so our first inscription, if we've read it tightly enough and we think about it in the context of the parameters put around Chinese officials under Mongolian rule, we begin to understand what this painting is and what it means to someone like Joe me. Whose friend Jiang Fu serves in Shandong Province, knows his friend is from there and decides to give him a gift. The gift of what it is that Shandong Province looks like. The gift of a description, an image that allows me to see his homeland for the first time. So that's sort of the unpacking of our first inscription. As we move through the other inscriptions that follow, will begin to see that that whole story that I've just unfolded is visible to the people and understandable to the people viewing the, the painting even after Zhao long-form Xiaomi had both died. So this is a 1334 Colophon that's written by someone named you achieve and which was transcribed at a later point in 1446 by Chen pool. So again, this is about close reading of our tech stripe. So this first section here, written on the first day of the 12th month of the Josh and reign of the Cijang. Josh on year in January in 1344 by UCI. That's when this above inscription is from. When you look down below, you see that there's a, there's a secondary sort of agenda to this Colophon written on the 15th day of the eighth month. And he does this the 11th year of the Geng Dong Re and in 1446 by Chen pool. This is a completely different dynasty, the chimp who lives in. And he has written this inscription which used to exist on the painting, back onto the painting as it exists. Now, at some point in time, this initial inscription got separated, which is what this secondary transcription of the Colophon tells us. So that somewhat complicated. But again, you have to kind of read your sources closely and realize that this piece of calligraphy written in 1446 is actually transcribing something from a 100 years earlier that got separated from the painting. So the history of this painting and of its inscriptions is very nuanced and layered. So this 1334 Colophon, which is reinscribe later in 1446 says The Honorable whooshing played with ink from early years on. And want to profound mastery of brushwork and conception and landscapes not bound by the things of this earth. So what does that mean? Whooshing has one of these pen names, one of these pet named our authorial names of the painter John Wong Fu. So the first thing that interests our friend UT here, the painter, not Joe me himself necessarily, not Shandong Province. And the idea that Geng Fu was a painter who paints landscapes that are more mental there about the mind. They have brushwork and conception and are not bound by the way things look in the world. So we can begin to think about why these paintings are, this painting is done in such a stylized manner. And we see this, this response here as that was what was appreciated, right? That fit the stylized perfection of kind of forms that. Uci is talking about things that are not bound by this earth, is good painting. In the 14th century. He continues even a single tree or a rock by Zhang Fu is different and all sorts of various ways from other people's. Moreover, his style set store by an antique refinement, far removed from anything ordinary and recent. So that phrase, antique refinement should trigger certain kinds of alarms to you read, especially in relationship to literati painting, this painting which is all about classical references. So when you CI is looking at this painting, he's seeing a kind of antique air over everything, which is not about how you see things in reality, but how you stylize things. So they look like the paintings of the past. And then he goes on to kind of compliment how wonderful gentleman is. It says after a 100 generations, this painting will still be regarded as a model for the time and it must be treasured. So he's calling is a masterpiece of painting. I suspect many of you, when first looking at the painting, have difficulty connecting to what makes us a masterpiece that's not realist. In the same way that some of Cauchy's images might be called realists are Quaid zones painting might be called realist. It's very stylized, but that was part of this antique air that UT is interested in. And again, as I said, this is a 1344 inscription that's later tacked on and reattach free inscribed by Chen poo. And he says that right here in the past, there was an inscription written by UCI here on a painting by the old gentleman songs where that's another nickname of Jammu. And the calligraphy was so simple and exquisite that it and the painting together could be considered twin masterpieces. So just as chariot I've mentioned to us, the calligraphy itself that gets added to the painting gets celebrated as a kind of independent masterpiece that's connected to the original work. And that's probably why it was separated that somebody wanted the calligraphy and sold off part of the calligraphy as separate from the painting to a later collector. So that's our second inscription. And again, one thing I want to emphasize is that UCI, when he looked at this painting, saw antique refinement. Which connects to this idea of a kind of class of sizing mode of painting. Remember how legal nuns painting was seen by Su Sure. And connected to catchers painting of almost 1000 years before, 800 years before and from the Song dynasty onward, this idea of stylized in your painting, so that looked ancient was the mode of good painting among gentlemen. So I have a little question here, sir, or pause and answer some of these. The red stamps Drew's asking about on the painting. Those are collectors seals. And the habit of stamping a painting like this with a CR begins in the late Song and into the Yuan Dynasty. Most of the seals that you see on this painting belong to the person who was California, will read last by the Qianlong emperor. This one does, this one does this one does this one. Say this one. The majority of these seals are all. I'm a collector seals of the emperor who owned this in the 18th century, loved it so much that he reinscribe did over a dozen times and kept revisiting it and having new reactions to the painting, which he would then inscribe. Some of the seals are the seals of the people who made it or maybe other inscriptions in the habit of adding that after your inscription again begin sort of in the Song dynasty and afterwards. So that's what the red seals are. And it revolves out of a tradition of official governmental seals being attached to documents that begins in the Han dynasty, at, at least in the Han Dynasty. All right. And it looks like that's all the questions I built up. Or if you have another question, just bump it and I'll get to it. So moving on to our next inscription. This is the same situation as the inscription that just happened before. In that this is the inscription that we have on the painting now was done in 1630. But it transcribes an earlier inscription that got separated from the painting. Perhaps. What we know is that the, that it was a poem that was written about this painting. And the poem is titled The poem on the Ottoman colors on the chow and hua mountains. And that if we look all the way down to the bottom with the date 1630, we see that the above poem, it was taken from the collected verse of Jang boy you. That's a person named Jiang, Yu. And Zhang who was the person who owns the painting at this time, asked me to copy it and add the writing of two other poets, young and fun. And this is written by donkey Chang, a very famous painting collector and painter himself in the 17th century. And so one thing that happens as this thing lives on is that people are reacting to it in terms of writing poems that end up in their collected poetry collections, but are maybe not even attached to the painting. And so at the request of the owner in the 17th century, this later person, don't Ci Chang, who was found a poem about this painting, has transcribed the poem onto the painting so that the person who owns appending can look at the painting and then see the poem that was written about the painting afterward. And the poem goes the old gentleman living south of Mount ping, the venerable Gong Jin. So that's exactly the person that John Wong Fu as inscribe it to here. Gong Jin, as a descendant of the JO, still cherish the memory of his homeland. Joe, Here Speaking of the Zhou dynasty, meaning that golden, our friend for whom this painting has made. He can trace his lineage all the way back into the Zhou dynasty in Shandong province. That gives you again this idea of the kind of disconnectedness that he feels now that he's separate and living in the south. Having come to the south, he took up residence south of Mount ping, which is near modern-day Hangzhou, the city of Hangzhou. But in his dreams, he still spoke the countryside language of the Eastern ci. That as he's still spoke the dialect of Shandong Province in his dreams, he could dream about plates that he'd never been to. This whole line refers to, this whole next line refers to the painter, the ba-da of teen on my lord ping UN. That's refers to jumbling f2, all of his different kind of honorary titles that could add it to him. His name after he dies, portrayed for him the mountains of his homeland on a sheet of paper. Healthy on hues of Adam. Autumn colors on the mount. Mount Chow are delicious. Plow men. So where's hermits and fishermen are scattered below. And you can see their little huts. And a little fishermen here. The man of Wu is white haired now and will never go home. Roll up the scroll and listen to the spring rain. And this last line, what the poet is acknowledging is that the person that's made for Gong Jin can never go home. He now lives somewhere else and he's old and he won't be able to travel home again. Partly because of his age, but partly because of the restrictions that are upon him. Because he is a Song Dynasty loyalist refusing to serve to new Yuan Dynasty rulers. And so this poem again understands immediately the situation under which this painting was made and why it was made for Joe, me. And then creates a whole new piece of artwork, a poem that responds to those emotions. And then on top of that, in 1630, this poem being published elsewhere in another book, is written on to the painting by a later observer. So you're getting a very nuance kind of layering of responses to this painting, but are about its past and its context, and reading that into the image and its inscriptions. Now the last inscription that we come to, that, that I've given you anyway for reading comes from a much later period. We're talking 450 years after the original painting is made. And it's written by the emperor whose ruling in a completely different dynasty, the Qing dynasty. And he's collected this painting and treasures. It has a kind of valued piece of painting history and art history. And his inscription tells us of a completely different kind of reaction to it. He writes the two mountains, Mount Hwa Nan Chao. According to various geographical records in books, have long been celebrated his famous beauty spots. And some time ago I acquired this picture by John Wong Fu and I valued it as one of my private treasures. Every time I opened it for view, my spirit would instantly yearned to visit this place. And that yearning to visit, that's actually at the core of the original paintings intent. And looking at this 350 years later, the emperor of a different dynasty, struck by that same feeling. He writes. Still from the scroll alone, I could only get a likeness would little of the artist's intention. Whoever in the second month, this year will on an inspection trip in the east in which I visited Chile, which is the home of trey Lee, the home of Confucius, and made offerings at Mount Tai. I turned back on completing these ceremonies and halted at Xiang to view the scenery from the city walls. On seeing the mountains in the northeast, I made inquiries at the local officials and learned that the one with the tall, sharply pointed peak here has about Hua future while the other one toward the west, but with a flat massive Top was Mount chow. So I'm traveling through this region. The emperor on his way back to the capital stops. It, stops for arrest at this small city and sees these mountains and it's told they are mount Juan, mount chao, the same mountains in this painting that he treasured. And so he hadn't realize that those mountains outside of the city with the same mountains in the painting. So in consequence, he orders his couriers to bring back from the capitol this particular scroll by whooshing another name for Geng Fu. I know it's a little complicated, but again, he's bringing back this painting by John Wong Fu. On its arrival, I found that it corroborated what he saw in most points. And at the view it showed had no essential differences. At that point, my gaze relax and I felt them exhilaration many times greater than in my imaginary journeys in the past. Surely this had been destined it. So one of the things of the emperor says, when he's looking upon this, that this scene that we're looking at here looks like Mount waffle tool and mount Chao as he's seeing them in 1748 from the city walls. But he goes on and says admittedly, an inscription by the painter Geng Fu. He says at Mount Chao lies on the east. While examining the records and seeing it with my own eyes, I found it to be rather to the west of Mount Hua. This must be no more than a moment's flip up the brush. So I've written down to recently compose poems, poems that the emperor is written himself, each alongside its proper mountain, one here, and one is inscribed here. And I'm noting the occasion here. And this is again inscribed by the imperial brush in 1748. So he says, well the artist got the directionality. Well actually this one's on these to net one is on the west. And I'm going to correct him because of course he's the emperor. So does a scene actually look like the mountains as, as the emperor would have seen them. Here our mouse chow unmount waffle true as they exist today in Shandong Province. And again, when we're thinking about this idea that the emperor is looking at this painting and saying, Oh yeah, that looks exactly like the paint that the bounds, I'm seeing them. As I'm seeing them, we begin to ask ourselves, well, how is the vision, actual ocular vision of the emperor being altered by the way in which he thinks about landscape. As established in these kinds of classical paintings by people like John Meng Fu and others who are interested in classical references, visual references to the past. And when we look at the actual painting in relation to these mountains, I can, they're vaguely alike, right? You can see some of this texturing and these vanes in the mountains here. But they're stylized in, in this mountain here, which looks almost much larger and further in the distance. In this image by Geng Fu about waffle Chu, which make granted BY being seen from a slightly different angle, does not quite have the same kind of symmetry up the core that is being shown in John Long foos painting. And that's part of this antique likeness that's being so valued by literati painters, stylizing the image so that it shows the patterns. Remember our, our Neo-Confucian ideal of looking at the patterns of the world and looking at what are called the kind of drag and veins of the mountain, the watershed, essentially, as it was made into a kind of metaphor of Dragon billions is what they are often called. And so again, the reality that the emperor seeing, he says that in fact, what he's seeing is exactly as the painting shows it. Even if maybe eastern west have been swapped. And what the emperor didn't know was that actually the course of the river that separates these eastern western establishes the east-west sort of difference for Jiang Fu was very different from the course of the river as the Qianlong emperors is viewing this particular location. In the 17th century that is, of the riverbed shifted over those 300 years through flooding and through other reasons. And so the emperor thinks that jumbo from us have just gotten his directions wrong when in fact the geography had changed over that period of time. So to wrap this up, this has been a complicated, sort of difficult set of texts to unwrap. Partly because our colophons in, in our, our inscriptions are happening at different times and some of them even reference earlier reactions to the painting. But if we begin to pick them apart one by one and set them in the right order. We can, we can begin to see that colophons inscriptions are really rich resources for telling us not only why the painting was made to begin with, but how people reacted to it later on. Some of the things that we're associating with this painting in its earliest moment of production. Or the fact that the person it's made for Joe MY foot, venerable Gong Jin. Cannot travel to this place that he associates with his own heritage. And that's partly due to this Yuan Dynasty ethnic hierarchy that puts Han Chinese at the bottom. Plus there's the restrictions on literati or these educated elites from row, from aristocratic families that decide not to serve the new emperor or they decide to remain loyal. And part of the way in which they're punished for that is they're restricted in their travels, meaning Xiaomi can't travel back to Shandong Province. And in general, when we think about what colophons inscriptions are, you know, what's fascinating about them again is that later audiences are constantly responding to the image through different motivations and criteria. And we can learn about how people looked at paintings and painting history from these, we can think about the idea of the archaic, classical kinds of references that people like you saw in the image. Flicking it fees mountains and saying, are these, are, these, these epitomize a kind of classical mode of painting. They don't look or have to look like the way I see them. And then at a later point, the emperor in the 18th century says, these are exactly how I see these mountains. Even though if we look at photographs, we wonder, how is it possible that these mountains look exactly like non-white and mount Shao, The ones that John Monks who painted are much more pattern IS much more simplified in order to gain again, that kind of classical simplified painting style that we associate with painters like Gou catcher. And lastly, there's this idea of the landscape is being very symbolic of identity and a place of the historical past and of the personal passed for someone like Joe me for whom this has painted. This is an image of his homeland and it must mean something very great to him to be able to see that. And to be thankful to gel mournful for painting it for him. And all of the reactions to it and later periods of time respond to that in one way or another, that sense of being displaced from your homeland. And so while this looks like a very naive and simple image of a couple of mountains and some trees and I know a couple of houses in-between and fishermen, given fact and Capulet encapsulates all of these different values of painting and geography. Also of service to government that were under sort of high scrutiny at this time during the Yuan Dynasty rule of China. This is one of only two dynasties in which foreigners are ruling over all of the, all of China. An ethnic minority group is ruling over the majority population of Han Chinese. So are there any questions I know that can seem very dense, but before we move on to the next object and how that has to do with Mongolian rule of China. Are there any questions about this painting? Alright, then let us push on to the next image. So this is a completely different kind of image made in the same period of rule. What could these things possibly have in common this Mandela dedicated to the Buddhist deity, the amount attacker via by Rava and made only 35 years after our painting. It made for a very different client and made with a very different technique. This is not painted as inscription tells you. This is a silk tapestry with a very particular kind of weaving. So let's talk about that technique first before we look at the image. So basic weaving involved just a warp and a weft to give you a kind of grid mechanism that increases the stability of your cloth. So you're individually spun pieces of silk or wall or whatever it is you're using. In this case it's silk. You create a grid. And the way in which you overlap those alternating 21 or spends three in one, gives you a different texture on the surface of the image and a different stability of course, of the fabric. That's your basic weaving technique where you're warp and weft her kind of alternating to create a grid. And the xin or the texture all depends on how you alternate those different threads going at right angles to one another. The warp, which is the sort of skeleton, and then the weft, which is what's woven in-between to give it again a different kind of texture or surface. This is more complicated than that though, as you can tell, this is not a simple gridded pattern. Instead, this is what's called a tapestry. And specifically it's a cursor style of Tapestry in which you are getting multiple discreet sections that are woven along the warps give you an image. It's like painting and thread. So Tapestry in general is when you only have the weft showing the warp, the under structure that's along the womb, that's sort of straight. Threads that you build your image around are never showing its always with the weft on top, which allows you to get a lot more kind of pattern. You never see the, you don't have to always see the, the gridded aspect of the Warp underneath. With cursor weaving, you have multiple discreet wife's for each image and allows for kind of image-making that's much more detailed. Detailed as this is this is quite a large thing. It's several feet by several feet, but still weaving at this close scale. This is the back of the head image. Gives you a sense of just how precise you can be with creating images that appeared to have earrings and eyeballs, and woven pattern designs and head dresses. This mode of tapestry, weaving, Kosovo weaving, is extremely time intensive and very image driven. Again, you can create images out up different colors of silk and how you weave them. A crop across the warp, sort of under structure of the tapestry or many of any woven material. And so that is how this is made. And I want you to put a pin in that. Because this technology with this, with this weaving comes as a result of the expansion of the Yuan Dynasty empire. We'll get to that in a minute. But if we ask ourselves what sort of an object is this not just from a technical point of view, but also from the image? We can begin to think of about how this image operates in ways that are maybe like an image we've already seen. So take just a minute or two and described to me how you're looking at this. How is this image organized? Just formally, right? Where do you begin looking? Where does your eye travel? Why does it travel in that pattern or in those directions? And how do you know what information to look at, when or which information is most important? So go ahead and throw that into the chat window, will have a somewhat limited amount of time to discuss this, but it's important for you to do some of the visual work of looking at this. Alright, so JSON states that immediately the circle with a dark blue background highlights what's ever in the middle of the painting. There is a strong symmetry as Christina is telling us, right. And your eyes go immediately to the middle with the symmetry that's across the center axis and across the horizontal axis, basically crossing in the middle. Right? So there's a central focus point again as Dn as saying, that's emphasized by color and size. The biggest image is exactly in the middle, like a bulls-eye More or less. And the dark color exactly helps to draw your attention to that as well. The alternation and tone of dark and light tone next to each other creates strong contrast. The strong geometry to it again is about the circle. The symmetry in the middle exactly. So Harrison saying his I start from the middle and then move to the outer circle and then all the way to a round. And there are these intersecting kind of circles and squares as Jessica puts, puts it right. And as you look at the image again, there are a variety of circles and squares. You can think of the outermost parameter of the image is a square in which you have this major circle inscribed into which you have a square inscribed into which you have a circle inscribed into which you have another set of boxes. And the central largest figure with the highest contrast at the middle. So great, you've got a great job describing how the image is organized and how it encourages us to see this object in a very specific way that's geometrically organized and symmetrically organized. And within each of these compartments, you might get a slightly different figure. But the compartmentalization, the geometric organization of this, is crucial to the way in which we're supposed to interact to this with this. And while we start off with the image in the middle is the most important. In fact, the way in which you're supposed to relate to this is from outside to m. So again, you started in the middle with the center. And this deity epicenter is a Buddhist deity, as has a very complicated name, Yamada talk AV I Rabbi Rava, conquer of death, the Adamantine tariff, fire. Adamantine again being a kind of indestructible idea of metal often. So he's a ferocious, terrifying deity that conquers death, has a bull's head. He has multiple arms and the central image. And if you look closely, you realize that there are multiple legs intertwined here as well. Here he is standing alone with two arms and two legs, and then two hooks, one in each hand. And then smaller versions are repeated around the perimeter and at these other points along the, along edges of this central square. And so we're getting slightly different manifestations of this particular deity, this angry, wrathful conquer death. And this is actually a version within the Buddhist system of the Bodhisattva of wisdom. So as you've seen the Bodhisattva of wisdom before is it's kind of peaceful deity. Here you have a wrathful, strong, bull-headed, multi armed, muscular version, which was popular in Tibetan Buddhism. So here's one of the other versions of the Buddha of wisdom that you've seen in the Chaka triad before. And again, to imagine that this Bodhisattva and this bull-headed angry deity are the same. The same, the same DNA, just different manifestations. As part of what Buddhism offers in terms of thinking about the multiple sides of any given kind of emotion or human trait like wisdom, for instance. As you move out from that center circle, you'll see that there are these three tiered arrangements with what looked to be like. Elephants, or sometimes they're called alligators. There's sort of composite beasts spraying these fire rainbows basically up and over in this sort of arc over the center. And these are actually visualizations of buildings. You can see the tiled roofs here, the eaves. And they're over these gateways. And they create gateways around that central figure, which are protected by these fiery arcs. As you move out to the outermost ring with that dense blue background, there are waves, fires, dismembered bodies, graveyards of the Tibetan Buddhist, esoteric Buddhist world and various other forms of Yemen. A TA, QRA, Yamada, taka, and other Bodhisattva's as well. In these upper corners, here is the Bodhisattva of Compassion, shown as a different form as a bare chested woman named tire off. And you see that again, this sort of object with its intersecting circles and squares, with its gateways, with its moat around it. It's actually visualizing a piece of architecture of a palace. And that geometric structure, we're calling it a Mandela because it does the same thing as the other mandala that you've looked at. It structures warship in a way from outside to n of the central deity of the object at the very center through a series of interlocking geometric arrangements. And so as you move across this mote through the gate, you're envisioning yourself walking up this three-dimensional space that had been compacted into a two-dimensional version. In order to approach a duty at the very center, the Bodhisattva of wisdom. And it's wrathful, angry form. And again, these angry forms and these Mondelez in particular are more popular and esoteric forms of Buddhism and particularly Tibetans styles of Buddhism, which is where this object connects to the expanse of the Yuan Dynasty empire under the Mongolian rulers. At the various, at the top and at the bottom, you have these colonnades of monks. Some of them are historical monks, lamas. You can tell by the way in which the hat is different than the hats worn by monks in central China. Llamas are monks that are particularly within the Tibetan style and Mongolian styles of Buddhism. You can see another Yi amount of tacos seated here. You can see another Bodhisattva and a more peaceful forms seated here. And then at the very bottom, you see a monotonic QRA, Yamada taka, intertwined with his lover. And they're actually in the middle of having sex, which is not something you see often in the forms of even the angry, passionate Buddhas deities in central China. But you see more often in the Tibetan and esoteric styles of Buddhism. And then in the bottom corner, you get the people who paid for it. And that again ties us to the Yuan Dynasty. Because the two on the left and the two on the right, they're all part of the royal court. So in, the royal court, paid for this tapestry to be made. This tapestry that celebrates esoteric style of, as, esoteric styles of Buddhism that have been imported from Central Asia and particularly the Tibetan regions. One of the reasons we know that it's not just from the imagery, but these little labels that tell us the names of each of these patrons, they're written in Tibetan script. And so this is being made if a capital in Beijing, which is called dot do under the Yuan Dynasty rule. But it's being made for a style of worship that originated very much outside of the heartland of China, in the Tibetan regions of East Asia, in the foothills of the Himalayan, where esoteric Buddhist practices is done, where Mondelez are used more frequently. And when you get these sort of wrathful or even passionate forms of gods. So these labels tell us who these four people Are. The two on the left are Coachella and his brother took two more. These are grandsons of Kubla Khan. Took them or becomes Emperor Wen zone. And you see on the right Buddhist Syrian boy Bhatia, bubble Bhatia, who are consorts of these two. So it's these two guys, these princes and their wives. And they're shown here in Mongolian court robe fashion, which has different head dresses and different styles of overlapping robes. And with this particular style of headdress, again, distinguishing Mongolians women's wear this sort of inverted cone or boots sort of shape in particular. And so this object made with esoteric style Buddhism for these patrons of the Court. Under, in China under Yuen dynasty, Mongolian rule identified through again the imagery through the use of the Mandla, through the Tibetan script and through the way in which the patrons are portrayed here. Just to historical kind of a tidbit. Took tumour, which is, I believe this guy has his brother and his brother's wife murdered in order for him to become emperor Renzong. And so this kind of an image made During Emperor Wen zones, rain in many ways was a kind of memorial to his brother and his brother's wife, but perhaps also a way of kind of making absolution for those trap a status. So again, if we're thinking about this particular tapestry made here in Beijing and the capital under the broader Mongolian sort of rule of Central Asia, parts of the Middle East, parts of Eastern Europe, and all of East Asia. We can think about this object being a product of the exchange that's now available. The exchange in religion. Including Tibetan esoteric style Buddhism that was practiced by the royal family of the Yuan Dynasty. As well as exchange in technology where artisans are coming from Western and Islamic central Asian modes, producing tapestries into the world of the Chinese court. Through this connectivity that's brought about by Mongolian unification. Silk, for instance, was used as a payment method and as tribute, gifts, almost like a currency in and of itself. In this empire across all of the Mongolian cognates that constitute in the 13th, 14th century the Mongolian empire. And so this object is a product of that connectivity with Central Asian weaving techniques and with esoteric Tibetan Buddhist styles of images for Buddhist practice. So I've run right up to the end with a minute or two left. I'm sorry if that felt a little rushed toward the end. Are there any questions about these two images and how we can use them to think about what life was like under Mongolian rule of China during the Yuan Dynasty. Last slide. Whoops. Mindy asks, well, how did took tumor become emperor if he had his brother killed us, how we became emperor, he wasn't challenged any longer by his brother, and his brother was poisoned. And this was common across especially earlier periods of royal intrigue. In fact, one of the reasons why the Mongolian empire splits into these four different con, it is because of all the infighting among the various sons and grandsons of Genghis Khan. Also, the impossibility of ruling all these different cultures into one kind of unified system contributes to that as well. Tour. Alright, if there are no more questions, we have one more class before we begin studying for the next exam. Next exam only covers between the last examine next class. So sixth classes. It will be online again. And just FYI, I'm considering making it open note as well. Which will make the question is more complicated, but will allow you a certain kind of flexibility. Take care everyone again, I have office hours later today at 415 if you want to come chat, my assessment of your essay should be done this week. Thanks. So Sarah asks about the writing course, and I'm still considering that, Sarah, I'll let you know soon. Thank you. Thanks, guys.


## [11. The Art of the Goryeo Dynasty in Korea](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/11-the-art-of-the-goryeo-dynasty-in-korea?module_item_id=2446436)
 Mm-hm. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Alright, we might as well get started today. I think by now you all should have received your grades for the first writing assignment and for your peer responses. I again, I don't have time to respond individually other than through grading rubric. But if you would like to chat about your essay on how to improve it, please come to my office hours which are, as you know, immediately before this class or after my second class today, which is 415 to five. You just use the link on the main page to open up a WebEx that takes you to my office hours. If you want to talk about those things. If you absolutely cannot make those office hours, that is if you have an obligation during that time, not if you just miss them, then you may email me to make an appointment at some other time. That being said, are there any questions about that, about the essay, about the peer responses that I can answer that are sort of more general, that are not specific about your response. So I just miss the first part of that. So I guess for the essays, what exactly are you are you looking for us to I guess? Like, what point do you want us to get to? Like, do you have any parameters for the essays or is it just panel? As long as we fill out the question and answer the question like cohesively. But so you mean for future essays as our trajectory as it's harrison? Yes, yes, there's a feature SAS for future essays. So the rubric is designed to give you a sort of basic stripped-down fundamental idea of what each section should be about. But often where people either failed to really fully kind of meet expectations or got points deducted was just basic argumentation logic, which is something I don't feel I have to add as a separate point on the on the rubric, did your sections linked together to make an argument? Or did they sit separately in some way? Or were your descriptions very sort of fundamental and not actually aiming toward your eventual hypothesis or comparison. The integration of the whole thing into describing what an artwork is likely to be based on your visual analysis. Was often more, more people slipped up. They follow the rubrics so tightly that they forgot that this is a piece of writing. So that's a sort of general point that you might take. But again, if every really specific things having to do with your essay that you want to talk about. Maybe it's better to talk about those during office hours that actually make sense. Just like all the rubric. But make sure you're, you're really analyzing the district or the the writing and making sure that it's right. I thought the question. So basically with rubrics, Yes. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Otherwise, what's the point of a writing assignment just so you can sort of check off boxes. It's not writing at that point exactly. We just have to kind of elaborate mixture that it actually looks like we're analyzing it and not just filling boxes statue. That's right. And there were likely I know the syllabus says there will be three writing assignments, but given how much time it took me to process all of these, if I only spend five minutes on each essay. And there are 300 essays, that's already like 25 hours of straight labor, which eats up often more than a week for me considering my other obligations for research and service. So I'll probably back the requirement to one more SAM peer-review. Okay. Would you like to would you like us to limit our writing to certain amount so that you don't have the midst a five-paragraph essay or no, it's not. It's not that necessarily. Sometimes Theseus essays to grade are the ones that are really tight and cohesive and, and, and pulled together in one paragraph. Sometimes I really enjoy the more elaborate essays as long as you're not blow V8 and as long as you're just not like producing excess foam to make it look, adding fluff in there and making it look like we put in more work and we actually did. Yeah. I mean, that's pretty transparent. Yes. Someone who tries to focus on their writing for a living. I'm I mean, I know when I'm biasing and so I can. Usually when others aren't too. And I, again, I tried to grade your essays with an eye toward some of you chose very surprising comparisons. And for that latter part of the essay, I tried to hold you accountable to the terms by which you were comparing and by that logic, rather than thinking, this doesn't make any sense to me immediately. And if your logic held true for your comparison and your hypothesis, I tried to give you as much credit for that as, as possible. So any other questions about DSA, as I know, it can seem a little bit tricky, right? But, but the point of writing is to give a reader, you're, your audience, a convincing description and analysis of an objects so that as I'm reading along or as any readers reading long, they can visualize the thing and they understand why it is you're talking about what you're talking about. And one thing, again, I tried to emphasize in my grading was that in my response to your essays, my sort of general responses that when you immediately jumped a sort of metaphorical language. And you're not looking at the piece and asking, what is the, what are the visual elements of the peace leading to in terms of these conclusions? What sort of knowledge can I connected to based on the visual evidence? Then you might as well be talking about your own fantasy really, cuz that's where metaphors end up, is. What does it remind me of? Okay, well, you can tell me it reminds you of a house, but if you're not specific about the fact that there is a sort of three-dimensional cube form at the bottom and the triangular lid with a handle on it, it together has the basic appearance of a house. Then I don't know what you mean when you say it's like a house, you have to be explicit about these things. That exercise of being explicit is an important exercise even if none, if you go on to do anymore art history ever, ever, ever again, jumping to conclusions will lead you to pour argumentation and logic wherever you apply it. So again, without knowing specifically what anybody's individual issues are, those are some general issues that happened then and there anymore questions about this? So should I move on to the lecture today? I'll give a couple of minutes to see if anything pops up in the chat. Make that an extra few seconds seeing nothing in the chat. I'll go on to describing today's material. So you have two objects today. One of which is a painting, a portrait painting inscribed twice in the upper corners. And one of which is a large set of wooden blocks used produce a very massive text. On the object on the right might not immediately strike you as a kind of artwork, something worth discussing in today's class. But hopefully, by building a story around that, we'll be able to understand. That's social and historical roles at the end of the Goryeo dynasty in Korean and also some of its artistic aspects. So last time we were in Korea, it was during the unified sheila period when Buddhism arrived and really took root at the court and among the aristocracy. The Goryeo dynasty, the next dynasty to rule over. A unified Korea, was also a highly aristocratic culture. And that sends much like China had been before the Song dynasty and much like japan was it add a similar term. That is, old families dominated politics and dominated the sort of economic and political life of Korea at this time. But there is a beginning of a kind of growing influence of some new ideas coming in from China, specifically Neo Confucian culture. And we'll talk about that particularly in relationship to the portrait of each AUM. Buddhist temples remain highly influential in politics. Again, this is much like situation as it exists in Japan at the same time, but a little bit different than in China at this time when there is late a Tang dynasty reaction against Buddhism, as we've discussed in previous classes. So like Japan, Korea at this time is still politics and creates time are still intertwined very tightly with old aristocratic families and the influence of the Buddhist church. When it comes to broader geopolitical politics in the region, the Goryeo rulers allied themselves more or less with whomever was in charge of northern China. And you could understand the geographically this makes sense. Because the rest of the Korean peninsula is surrounded on all sides by water. The land border that is shared it is with the northern part of China when it is China. Which is to say that for the first part of the Song Dynasty, what we call the Northern Song period, the Goryeo were allied with Fifth Song Dynasty Chinese rulers. I'm sorry, there's a typo in here. This shouldn't be against Northern China. I'm not sure how that slipped in there. But the border there with Northern China is Song Dynasty territory. And so the Goryeo and the song are aligned when the Keita and people who establish the Liao dynasty and the northern parts of China encroached on the northern territories of the song. The Goryeo people began to ally themselves with the heat on by paying tribute to the kit on court. And so again, the regional politics here that we discussed with the song period in terms of having always this pressure on the northern part of the Song dynasty. Geography of China. First from the Liao dynasty and the western Xia Dynasty, and then from the Jin Dynasty, these non-Chinese courts that establish themselves in the North. The politics of career were really determined by who is ruling in the North. When the Jin Dynasty takes over that same region from the Liao, the Northern, what we think of as Northern China. Now, this was a new, a new ethnic people at the junctions. And when the Germans were in charge and establish the Jin Dynasty in the North, the boreal allied with them. So the basic takeaway here is that the Goryeo was always allied with their geographic neighbor on, against the mainland along that border. Now as this comes into the period we've just talked about during the Yan dynasty in the Mongolians have not only taken over the northern part of China, but all of the southern part of China eventually as well and rule over it as the Yuan Dynasty, which we discussed last class. Korea becomes a vassal state to the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty. The kings are still allowed to rule in, in name. But politics are determined by the relationship to the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty Court. So the kings of the Goryeo are still nominally in charge. But they're tied to the Yuan Court in multiple ways. They're obligated to send tribute. Major political decisions are made through the Yuan Dynasty Court in Beijing. And one way of ensuring this connectivity, Mr. intermarriage. So most of the Gordo kings at this point are married to princesses of the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty Court and princes of the Goryeo Kingdom. Before they come of age to become king. They're actually raised in Beijing at the Yuan Dynasty Court. Almost like a sort of hostage situation which ensures a connectivity to the Goryeo kings and influence over them as well. And this use of the Korean peninsula can even be seen in the attempt to Kubla Khan to try and invade Japan from Korea. In mass amasses a huge army to move over. The IOC to Japan from Korea, uses Korean forces and uses the Korean Navy to do this. Has plans are foiled, I think twice, by typhoons that come in and destroy the Navy. And this is where the sort of mythos, mythological when the Kamikaze when, which many of you might know from World War two, Japanese bomber pilots who describe self-described as Kamikaze, assertive, aggressive or frightening or monstrous wind. This is supposedly the force that destroys coolies armies and allows Japan to remain independent from the Yuan Dynasty Mongolian rule at this point. So as you can see, during the late Goryeo period, when we're looking at it, this politics of the invaded sort of northern regions of China are central to Goryeo dynasty politics. And that's where our first object comes into play. And what kind of an object is this? This is the image that you're seeing now, is one block of 80 thousand wood blocks that are carved on both sides with texts from the canon of Buddhist classical sutras. And in essence, it is a library of the central texts of Buddhism. And the name of this object as we're thinking of it, this library, the Pullman DJ, 80 thousand Tripitaka, translates to the 80,003 baskets. So there's quantum numbers happening here. But Tripitaka, where three baskets refers to early modes of transmission and teaching of Buddhism, three different modes of transferring the Buddha's ideas in the world. And so again, a kind of concepts, concept at the core here is about of a library or canon of texts. There are over 1500 different titles among these 80 thousand would block some of them very short, just a few pages long. Some of them hundreds of pages long. And you can think about this again, is the kind of almost like a Bible, right? The Bible is in Christian faith, is composed of a variety of different books, each of which was written separately and then brought together as a kind of compiled group of teachings and edited, creating a canon of different religious texts. And that is more or less what the Tripitaka, chorionic, or the Pullman DJ is. There are 52 million individually carved characters on these wood blocks. If you laid them all in a line, it would stretch for 60 kilometers. That is over a marathon. And the weight of all of these wood blocks, because they chose a special kind of very dense wood, is over 280 tons all supported on the shelves in this temple in South Korea. So what is the point of making a library like this? And that's where I want to turn to our text. Oops, I guess I, I've, I've jumped the gun here a little bit. So again, when we ask ourselves what is the point of producing these texts, we have to think about how Buddhism spreads and we've talked about this in several classes. There talked about the role of individual monks. Monks like Shenzhen, spreading ideas, or monks like Bodhidharma spreading the ideas of Buddhism. We've talked about envoys that moved from court to court. We've talked about artworks as well. Sculptures in the way in which those or fresco paintings in the way in which those transmit the ideas of Buddhism. But central, of course, to all of this is written texts themselves. And the spread of Buddhism involves, as you can imagine, between all of these different geographic areas, lots of different translations, and the spread of these sutras, which I think, sorry, go back just one slide. The definition of a suture. Did I drop that in here? A sutra is actually it's interesting. It's like literally translated from the Sanskrit. I think it means a thread. And it's therefore kind of metonym for the texts itself as being threaded together. A group of texts that talk about Buddhism in one way or another. An individual texts of Buddhism that talk about different aspects of the Buddha are each called sutras. And the act of spreading them again, is central to spreading the ideas of Buddhism, of disseminating those ideas. I'm sorry. I'm not really reading my slides very well today. Here suture is define a Sanskrit word, literally a string or a thread. And often just like in Confucian texts and like a lot of early religious texts, they come in the form of a dialogue, sometimes between the Buddha or a form of the Buddha and a moral person, sometimes between various forms of Buddhism, Bodhisattva's. And so in this class we're thinking beyond sort of sculptures and frescos in terms of the way those spread ideas and thinking about the production of texts and what that means and how that's done on especially large scales throughout East Asia. So here's where I thought we were, we were going in my slides. So when we ask ourselves why were these sutras translated, written, and disseminated, we can actually look to one of the more widely read sutras, Lotus Sutra. To tell us about this, in the chat window, I want you to think about this question of how and why we're sutures spread through this text. What does this tell us about the spread of religion through writing? Mm-hm. Alright, all of you guys are doing a great job of sort of pulling out of this text, which most religious texts or like this gets a little repetitive. But the core idea here is just as you've all sort of focused on, that, the text itself acts as a kind of embodiment of the Buddha. And those people who helped to spread the text. Even if just one line are made, at least within the Lotus Sutra and the discussions that happen in the Lotus Sutra like the Buddha. And in that sense as, as one of you, rightly put it, I think Ryan, this is a lot like the AMI to Buddhism that we talked about in Japan, which is happening really at a very similar time. And so this emphasis on spreading Buddhism and giving the people who spread Buddhism, the practitioners that helped to spread it in whatever way, whether it's just saying that in boots Suez an ammeter Buddhism or as a lotus Sutras says, helping to spread the texts by reciting it, or by reading it, or by writing it. That that person who does that is given of a strong benefit for, for doing so, you are treated as if you are like the Buddha. You'll be showered with praise, incense, flowers, et cetera. And then any place where the text exist as well as this Lotus Sutra proclaims anyplace where it's preach strat or where it's recited are copied. In those such places. Should be both towers made of the seven gems or religious sites. So the text itself carries the sacred nature of a Buddhist temple in its own right or of the Buddha. And in that sense there are parallel to be drawn to the nimbly to practice in AMI, to Buddhism. And so again, we have a suture here and one chapter of it. Is talking about how wonderful and beneficial that is for people to spread other sutras, to spread various words of the Buddha. And again, within the object that we're looking at today, the Tripitaka quarry, Diana. You have 1500 different sutra texts. And some of them were more emphasized and certain sex than in others. And many early sutras were left out of our particular object for today. But the emphasis here is on the dissemination of the words of the Buddha, of the various ideas of the Buddha and of course, his followers. As again, with most early religions, the prophets themselves are not in writing down these ideas. They preach these ideas and generations off to hundreds of years after their death. Certain canonical texts get written and use to help spread. Very different, perhaps ideas and the original profit might have preached, but all within the general umbrella of the Buddhist church, although sometimes within very specific sects like AMI to Buddhism or Zen Buddhism, etc. There was a question at the top that I miss the picture as a portion of the overall piece or is it the apiece? So the picture I've given you today of the Tripitaka, Korean or which is the easier of the names of this objects. First object for it, for me to say is just one of the 80 thousand word blocks used. And it's meant to just be kind of portion because I can't show all 80 thousand in one in one image. So yes, it's just one portion of the overall, of the overall piece of the overall group of texts. But again, reading our Lotus Sutra, we realize that praise goes to anybody who helps to spread the ideas of Buddhism for repeating the text of Buddhism. And therefore are multiple wood blocks that helped to spread these texts. Extra double, triple, exponential praise is put and anybody who would spread the sutures at that kind of a level with only reproducible technology. But this library of 1500 different sutras, different canonical texts of Buddhism. And the people who do that gain a certain kind of merit and respect in their own right. So that brings us not the absolute answer why, right? Why it is that these wood blocks are produced to help spread the words of Buddhism, which within Buddhist practice, as appraise the ball thing, something for which you earn merit and praise. This suture that I'm showing you. Now. Is not part of the group that we're talking about. This is the earliest illustrated book in world history and the earliest complete printed illustrated book that exist. This is the Diamond Sutra from a printed version dated to 868 at the very end of the Tang dynasty that was found in a familiar place to us in one of the caves at Dunhuang. And again, one of the ways in which we're thinking about printing technology is through the fact that it not only helps to spread these ideas of Buddhism more, more quickly, but also as a kind of technology within world culture. This is the first time that we get that kind of reproductive technology that allows you to take texts and disseminate them and spread them at large scales. Before this point, a text's had to be hand written and hand-copied one text at a time. And for a lot of monks, that was the labor that they undertook. At monasteries, the hand copying of these texts with hand copying comes mistakes. Often. When you have an edited woodblock version, you're repeating the exact same text each time, helping to disseminate, decide the idea with each printing at a much faster rate, even though it takes more labor to produce the wood blocks themselves. So what is woodblock printing technology? Woodblock printing process starts like any other piece of writing with a written copy. And that copy has to be transferred to especially prepared piece of wood. The woodblock is planed and before it's even plain that is made, made flat. It has to be treated and dried so that as we discussed with woodblock carving, technology was assembled woodblock carving in Japan. The wood doesn't crack and therefore distort or break the text over, over time. So special pieces of wood are dried out, prepared and planed. And then you'd take the written copy and paste it face down onto the block. The reason you have to paste it face down is that when you take a print later, you want it to be in the writing to be in the right or correct direction. So you paste it face down onto this woodblock. And then you cut the characters out around the Pasted copier, leaving wherever there is ink or was Inc, as elevated text and carving away everything but those elevated characters. And this is of course the most time intensive part of the process that has to be done very carefully so as not to Nick or break any of the radicals or parts of the character that give it meaning. Once that's finished, the block itself is ready to reproduce the text. And see, as you can see here, the text is written in reverse because when you take a print from it, your paper is being laid down on that reverse text on an inked block. Picks up the text now in its original format as it, as it was written in the original paper and ink. So you press the paper to the block once it's been inked up and the excess ink has been taken off. You remove or pull the paper off. And you have two pages of whatever text you've carved into the woodblock. And so our wood blocks have texts on both sides. And there are two pages to each of these sheets with his margin in the middle separating those pages. And if you have ever seen a classic Chinese texts, we know that the two pages are folded along this margin. And then these excess margins here on the far sides are used to bind the book together. And so this texts would be read on one page. You would turn the page along this fold. And then you would see the next page on the opposite side as this text. And so that's our basic, that's our basic process of creating these what blocks. And each of the wood blocks, of course, is a dependent Don, whoever's written the original calligraphy for their style of calligraphy and for the accuracy of the text. And one of the ways in which you can date various or the text is through not only the woodblock carving technology, but through the styles of the text itself. And here's an example of an early printing from these wood blocks from the Tripitaka, chorionic, the 80 thousand Tripitaka made in Korea in the 13th a century. And as you can see, this is structured a little bit differently than the kind of text I just showed you. In that there is no center margin or void that allows you to fold the paper over. That's because these are the texts were organized accordion style, where it would all run more or less like a hand scroll from beginning to end, from right to left. And it would just be folded along regular margins. To create, again, an accordion style book. So that's how this or earlier version of, of printing worked for Tripitaka, Corey Ana, and this particular text. Now that we understand how it's made, now that we understand the motivations for making at right has a specific historical contexts that also enables us to think about why this particular set of made of wood blocks was made in order to reproduce the sutras of Buddhism. The first time this has made is during the 11th century. Now your dates for the object or 13th century dates. The reason for that is because the original set of wooden blocks was destroyed during the Mongolian invasion. And each time the wood blocks were made, they were made more or less as a result of those geopolitical politics along the northern border of China. The first commissioning of his wood blocks was during the Liao invasion. And as a direct result of the Liao invasion of the Korean Peninsula. The idea being that by commissioning this large-scale production of Buddhist texts, you gain merit at a large scale as well. You're disseminating the sutra much faster than hand copying. And you have created this mechanism for reproducing the word of the Buddha at again, massive scale. And then mirror. It hopefully leads us to a certain kind of protection, right? It has a kind of aperture apotropaic function in that it protects the country from these invasions that are coming from the north of China, whether it's the Liao or the Mongol invasion, becomes later. After the Mongol invasion has settled, the new set is reproduce again to sort of protect the realm, protect the Goryeo realm from future war and invasion. One of the side effects, as I've already mentioned, of producing a text like this or group of texts like this. Remember they're 80 thousand individual wood blocks each with two sides for printing. And they reproduced 1500 different texts. Is that it consolidates the various texts of Buddhism into what we think of as a cannon, into a kind of in club and, and out Club of texts, texts that are, because they're included in this mode of reproduction, spread much wider and much quicker. And that helps to reinforce the importance of those specific texts in the world. Creating more or less a canon of early texts of the kind of right or correct texts of Buddhism. There were many earlier texts, some of which we only know of in fragments from pieces of writing in earlier sites like at Dunhuang that were not included in the Tripitaka, Corey Ana, and have since faded from practice and from Buddhist memory. Really, if it weren't for the excavation of these texts in archaeological sites, we would not know they exist. Whereas when you have printing and you get multiple forms of these have the same exact text, reproduce the likelihood of surviving and continuing its practice as a kind of live or active sutra is much greater. A few other special features of this particular set of texts that Tripitaka, Korean ah, a very particular Wood who was chosen to reproduce and wood from magnolia trees. And that's because the wood is very dense and less prone to breaking or cracking with time, the fiber of the wood as very fine. The blocks that were used to produce them OR soaked and boiled in salt water to help stabilize and preserve the wood. And they were dried for years in the shade. So rather than than being in the direct sun, heats things up faster, creates more cracks. Is Arabs left in the shade dry for years before they're even carved. So all these modes at preserving these blocks are put into practice even before they become the blocks that reproduce the Buddhist canon. And the surfaces themselves are lacquered to make them impermeable to water, so that water can seep into the wood and then create cracks or distortions of the original text. Let's see where I am here. And so that covers are kind of basic understanding of this set of wood blocks that reproduced for Buddhist merit. And as a part of an apotropaic function to protect the Goryeo from invasion doesn't work the first time obviously. Because the Temple that house these was burned down including, and that destruction included all of the woodblock. So they had to be re carved again after the Mongol vision. And as we know through Buddhist practice, spreading these texts in any way, shape, or form helps to add to your own merit producing them as such as this kind of consolidated Library of the important texts of Buddhism helped to also establish a canon of Buddhist texts that survived over a long period of time. So a question here. Have the wood blocks cracked as of right now, actually, actually don't know. I've never seen these in person. And I haven't kept up on this particular set of objects. But I imagine, I know that this a set of wood blocks is actually a unesco World Heritage Object or site and a national treasure of Korea. And so I imagined quite a lot of energy is put into preserving these. I think they're still kept in the open like this, but the temple itself is wrapped in a modern skin of glass, I think. And someone told me who had been there to keep things climate controlled. So these objects that are now 700 years old are again, considered a national treasure. And they've all been scan, I believe as well. I don't think people take prints off of the originals any longer. And again, just to set this in perspective, if we look at printing technology, the first evidence of woodblock printing of texts comes in China in the Han Dynasty, somewhere around the year 200. And woodblock printing is often used to create not only reproductions of texts but of, of images as well. Earlier I showed you the first complete illustrated World Book. In it. Yeah, the Fergus complete book in world history, a printed book in world history. That's what I mean to say. The first complete printed book in world history, that ninth century Buddhist texts where the image up at the front. Where was I going with that idea? But we have evidence of fragments of earlier texts in, or their images using woodblock printing dating back as early as the second century. And not just for Buddhist purposes, but for other purposes as well. And again, one thing to keep in mind is that woodblock printing, whatever you've carved is set on that unified piece of wood. As such, you can't shift characters around once they've been carved into the Word, which is its advantage and away, reproduces the same time every time. There is evidence of movable type being invented in China as well. And that's the type that those of us who come from a kind of modern or especially Euro-American background are used to thinking of in terms of the invention of printing and the printing press, these movable type prints. And we think about that especially as through the history of the production of texts during the Renaissance and the printing press in Europe. And it's invention in and around 1400, which we associate with people like Gutenberg and the Gutenberg Bible being the first printed edition of the bible. But moveable type printing was invented in China. And even with metal, metal cast characters and movable type, which were invented in Korea at a much earlier time, hundreds of years earlier. We can think about other kinds of modes of printing that were maybe much more used to etchings on metal plates. Not something that was popular in East Asia, but which is invented first in Europe in practice there at large scale, beginning in and after the renaissance. And it's not until the late 19th and early 20th century that we get forms of printing that involve photographic technology, things that we're more used to. And sort of brief history of those kinds of photographic technologies for reproduction as listed here below. Most of which we don't even use anymore because we're communicating almost entirely digitally. But all of this is to say woodblock printing invented first and practice first in China for the spread of text and of images. Movable type with wood and movable type of metal cast first invented in East Asia as well. But the moveable type doesn't really become very popular in East Asia for one particular reason, which is that the language itself is so varied and complicated. And there's so many different characters that woodblock printing in a single woodblock actually remains more efficient as a way of reproducing texts than constantly going and seeking out one from 10 thousand characters and placing that in a grid to reproduce over and over again the way that movable type printing works. Within the Latin alphabet, you just have to find the right capital lowercase, or punctuation letters and arrange those in your casing blocks in order to reproduce texts so you reuse each of those individual movable type pieces. Whereas up until the 19th, 20th century, woodblock printing was still the easiest and most reliable way to reproduce East Asian texts because it's not an, a Latinate alphabet. You can't just take the same 26 letters and capitalised in lowercase forms and arrange them in many, many, many more characters to pull off movable type printing in East Asian languages. One of the interesting things that happens throughout the cultures of printing in East Asia, China, Korea, and Japan is you get sutras that are copied with a variety of different methods. Combining often printed forms and handwritten calligraphy in sort of mixed media reproductions. So here's this 11th century Japanese sutra text where all the little lotus is underneath are, are stamped and printed in different colors and the writing, but the writing itself is hand done. Similarly here you have little stoop buzz into which writing is added from a sutra. So each individual character becomes its own little holder you kind of relic in a stoop. But in this visualization of the Buddhist text that relates back to our Lotus Sutra idea that even a single word of a Buddhist sutra text is wholly in and of itself. There are very elaborate tie end versions of sutras that are reproduced, hand painted and also in printed versions. You have a Goryeo dynasty Lotus version of the Lotus Sutra. Printed in gold on Indigo died mulberry paper. And this is about and silver as well. There's Silver over here. This is about as high class as a sutra. Could, could be. And if you look at the individual kind of line work in this hand done image, you can imagine just how much effort and time probably went into producing this particular version of the Lotus Sutra. And again, one thing that we might discuss in that many of you have probably been harboring as a kind of question or suspicion is, well, okay, printing is a really fascinating technology and it helps for the dissemination of ideas that are much larger scale certainly. But is it art? And the way in which we might think of it as related to art. Or the ways in which we see very early compositions of Buddhist imagery that we don't have and paint form any longer because these printed images or so early. And these images as they are printed, become canonical in and of themselves. So artists began to copy these compositions that are coming with early printed versions. And so you'd get the spread of visual modes of conveying Buddhist ideas that are linked through these printed forms that are spread all over East Asia. And the same can be said of the calligraphy or the style of writing used by the original copyists to create these wood blocks prints. These styles of suture writing become uniform because the print itself again never changes unless it breaks. Which means that the same style of composition for calligraphy, AI is being used in various temples across East Asia due to the style of the original printed text. So calligraphic styles and compositions of Buddhist imagery are spread throughout other kinds of media, other kinds of art through this reproduction technology. In a later class, we'll be thinking about this object below a woodblock printed image, often called The Great Wave, but originally titled under the way of Off Kanagawa. And we'll think about where woodblock printing develops as a separate from religion, as a kind of pleasurable art form in and of itself, with multiple kinds of tone, tonality and colors added to them as well. And multiple poly chromatic woodblock print production first develops in China, but moves very quickly to places like Japan and takes on its own kind of life. Fair? Yeah, the, the, this is as dark as I said, this is a piece that many of you might know. It's become quite popularized and we'll put it in context in a later course. I see Marie is asked, are these written in Chinese characters? Yes, they're written in Chinese characters. In this relates again to the idea that in Japan and also in Korea, fs time within the church and certainly within aristocratic court culture, you communicated often in written Chinese. Other questions that have come up. Cortana asks, why would you put these things in the walls are good at Dunhuang to preserve them. And too. So it's not just about thieves in invaders, but it's also tomb. It's actually right. So that's one reason right, to protect them. When the area was under political. What am I what's the word? I'm trying to look for? Confusion. Conflict. They were sealed into walls and sometimes either people who seal them into those walls never came back to get them or were killed perhaps in the conflict until they remain sealed in to the walls at Dunhuang. And some of our very earliest written texts in about Buddhism or even in that period come from these little libraries at Dunhuang where they'd been preserved into the walls much like the crypt under the foam and temples sort of time capsule into the ninth century in China. So Drew is asked when, when they were handwritten. Yeah, there by nature. They're variations that happen accidentally, you Mrs. stroke here or there. And with some words when you forget to add a stroke or you read it as, as a different thing than the text actually has written. Perhaps you don't understand or know a character. Sometimes scribes were actually illiterate, which is crazy to think of there just copying things as they saw them. That the meaning changes if you get a couple of different strokes wrong. And some of these characters are if you write a character, you do know, but it's not the character that's written. You might change the radical, for instance. I think that's all the questions that have come up. So that's our woodblock printing technology and our particular focus on this walk. An object made to protect the Realm Through the accumulation of merit and the spread of Buddhist ideas during the Goryeo dynasty. And it again shows us how tightly linked political culture in Buddhism were at this, at this time. So let us move on to our next object. And again, let's keep in mind our central questions. Howard Buddhism and Neo-Confucian is important to the Goryeo and Joseph rule and Korea. Most of our class is focused on the Boreal period. With this object, we move to ideas that help to establish JSON rule and Korea. So keep that in mind as we transition to this portrait of EJ on, I hope the idea of the importance of Buddhism to the Goryeo dynasty rule has become obvious from what we've just discussed, as well as the effect of the Mongolian empire in terms of the production of Buddhist texts in Korea and the spread of those Buddhist texts through printing technology. Both of these central questions relate to our second object as well. Especially in relation to the effects of the Mongolian Empire and in terms of the effects of Neo-Confucianism on Korea. So let's move to that object now. And we'll start with just a little comparison just to sort of exercise your brains because you've been listening to me drone on for a little while. So just in the text box and chat box, compare these two paintings and I've given you have identified. You know who they are, more or less when they were painted. But just do a little comparison here and see what similarities or differences you find. As many of you have rightly pointed out. The sort of positioning of the portrait in terms of its general composition as almost exactly the same. You have a figure seated, hands together and with the cuffs of robe together, right, with just one finger kind of sticking out. And they're seated. Not quite into three quarters angle more like oh, it's like a seven eighths angle, I guess off of off of off of center. So they're looking just slightly beyond you as, as the viewer. And they're seated in chairs with very little else around them in terms of background information, their chairs or in this case a and case b, j, you on the table as well, are all the things that are added to give us context. And with the case of ego, and as, as you said, they're the inscriptions that give us out of context as well. And so just from looking at that kind of basic structural similarity between the way in which these fingers are arranged for us. In these images. We can suppose that there's a relationship happening here. Unintended relationship. That is about how you compose yourself in a formal portrait. And if you look at the dates right, here is a tenth century painting of the emperor of the Northern Song Dynasty Emperor, One of the emperors of the Northern Song Dynasty title. And the portion of EJ urine. You can suppose through just chronological. Ordering that the sort of formal portrait style of the court of the Song dynasty is being emulated or imitated in this portrait of EJ human. That is of a figure seated looking out just sort of off center. From looking straight down at the viewer. And in a kind of formal robe that structures the body underneath it and surrounded by just a select few objects such as the chair that's being sat in the, in the case of uj on the objects that sit just behind him As as well. And this was entirely intentional. You have here a Korean minister EJ, you're using the language of Chinese and especially Song Dynasty Chinese portraiture to, to, to convey a sense of who he was. And so think about that similarity in language and that as a, as a conscious choice on behalf of the painter and the sitter to be portrayed in a formal seated arrangement that is particular to Chinese and especially Song Dynasty precedence. Let's see if I can play anything else here. But again, these are from very different periods. And there are slight differences that help us to think about kind of who these people were, right? You see the golden fixtures and the red Throne of the emperor as well as the hat. With the two stiff sort of fabric pieces extending out behind the hat marks. It has a very different marks them as very different kind of person than the Korean official EJ Yuan, who is with a much more truncated black cab. Both of them are shown as mature men with beards and mustaches. And both of them have their little feet resting on these stools as well. So the feet aren't directly on the ground. And Hegelians inscription, inscription on his painting as well as the other objects tell us a few other things about him as to why he might be emulating these Song Dynasty ideas of formal portraiture. And these inscriptions, one of them is by EJ urine. And it's written again in Chinese text, just like our sutures were. And it's written 21 years after the original portrait is painted when edu and his back in Korea, excuse me, describing how young he looked in the original painting and how old he's gotten since fan a feeling. I certainly have looking at older images of me as, as well as well. So this text is written around 1330 and reflects back on the original date of the paintings creation, which is 1319. The other text has written by someone named tongue being null. And this person has Chinese, not Korean. And it explains how E, E, J, U, and had this portrait painted while he was accompanying the Korean king Johnson in Hangzhou in China. So not only from the formal comparison for the writing that is happening again in Chinese text. Not only in these two factors, we also get Tang Ming long explain, explaining to us that this was done in China, which means that jay urine was present in Hangzhou to get this portrait made in 1319. So this connects to Chinese culture and a variety of ways, including the one that, including the fact that he's actually spent time in China. There are a couple of other little hints in the background to that explicitly link this image of a Korean official to classical Chinese heritage. You can just make out in the background a text here in a little box with its title on it called The Book of Changes, the aging. This is one of the central Confucian texts that we talked about all the way. Going back to the Han Dynasty. The Book of Changes, the divination texts about, again, sort of predicting what will happen in the future. There is a bronze tripod here, 123 legs, not dissimilar from our four-legged tripod. That establishes another classical link. Tripods like this were made in imitation of ancient tripods during a Jones Day. But this tripod is likely meant to be an antique that has been collected by EJ eun and signifies a connection to the deep past and China stretching all the way back to the Shang and Zhou periods. And remember the aging as a Zhou Dynasty text as well. And so each of these things in the background helps to link the portrait to a classical Chinese heritage. And then you can just barely make it out here. This is an old painting. It's a little broken up. But you can make out this zither or Chin, an instrument that gentlemen often would play out for one another. Sort of like playing the piano or something. And so the portrait is giving us all sorts of citations back to original Chinese sources and tells us that it was done in China. So what does a Chinese, what does a Korean officials doing in China? So who has EJ Yuan? He was a government minister for the Goryeo dynasty. At this time when the Goryeo is under the sway of Mongolian rule in China. So in order to become a government official, edu and had the passes imperial examinations not only in, in the Goryeo Court, but also in Beijing at the Yuan Dynasty, Mongolian court. The reason he's in Hangzhou and 1319, which is where he gets his painting done, is because he's accompanying the king there, the king of Korea, King John Johnson. And this tells us again another sort of piece of evidence of connection between the Goryeo and the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty in China. Remember the kings of the Goryeo dynasty were educated and brought up in the Yuan Dynasty Court in Beijing. And as Korean minister. And he had Korean ministers of course, around him helping, helping him on his travels and this particular set of travels. And 1319, King Jong zone is going not only to Hangzhou, where there's paintings made by a Chinese painter of a Korean official, but also to, to Beijing and even to Tibet as well. This king that each AU and his accompanying is the 26 king of the Goryeo dynasty. And yet another sign that he's linked to China as Eddie simultaneously is given these other titles within the Yuen dynasty geographic rule. So it was called The Prince of Shenyang. Shenyang is a major city in the north of China. This king was the son of a Yuen dynasty or Mongolian princess. So he's inter-married with the Mongolian ruling family. He had three Korean wives as well as one Yuen dynasty princess has a wife. And remember, under Goryeo, under Yuan Dynasty influence, all the Goryeo princes like King Jong zone had to live at the UN court until they took thrown. And so that's why the King is traveling through China. The King of Korea is traveling through China, which is y ij AU and as his minister is traveling through China. So EJ and when he returns to Korea, is known in particular for one contribution to Korean culture. Not just this elaborate painting done to signify all sorts of knowledge of the Chinese past. But through the fact that ego and helps to translate and to introduce the ideas of Neo-Confucianism to Korean court. And particularly the ideas of Zhu Xi 2i is someone we haven't talked about yet. But his writings about Confucianism become core writings of Neo-Confucian thought, especially in the Goryeo dynasty as they spread to Japan at this time as well. And in the Ming and Ching Dynasty periods in China as well. And he synthesized all of these sort of new confusion thoughts into a group of texts that again became from the 14th century on used in the imperial examination system in China. And that spread those ideas to Korea and Japan and its edu. And who brings his ideas back to Korea and helps to spread them at court and among other officials there as well. And when the Yuen dynasty eventually falls. And when the Goryeo dynasty falls soon afterward. And these Neo-Confucian ideas or a reinstituted not only in China, in the Ming Dynasty, which follows the Yuan Dynasty in China, but also during the dynasty that follows the Goryeo period in Korea, the Joseon dynasty, which rules for the rest of imperial Korean history. And the Goryeo or Joseon dynasty establishes as its core principles of government. Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism and his ideas about how a proper Neo-Confucian government worked. And those ideas, perhaps they would have come to Korea on their own. But it was the person in this portrait, EJ you on that brought them to Korea and helped to spread them. And so that's how this idea, again of who this person is Connex Korea to China, to new Neo-Confucianism and to Yuen dynasty rule in, in particular. And so with that again, we can see that the Mongolian rule over this united space of East Asia, connecting through to Central Asia and the Middle East helped to disseminate and spread many new ideas throughout what we think of as Korea and China are the two objects we talked about last class. Charming foos painting, which is about geographical displacement. And this new system of rule in China under foreign rulers. We talked about the spread of ideas through the taka, Mandela and the spread of esoteric Tibetans styles of Buddhism into the kind of heartland of China at this time. And then with these two objects, we can think about the Korean position in relationship to Mongolian dominance over this whole region at this time. We can explain why someone like EJ urine is accompanying the King through to China because of this Yuen dynasty Mongolian connection. And as a related note, one of the other paintings that we've talked about, not yet in the context of Yuan Dynasty China, but in the context of Japan at this time, at the same exact time, is also the result of displaced people fleeing the invasions from the north to Japan. And that's where some of these monks who are, who were practicing Zen or Chan Buddhism are thing the mainland and moving into Japan at this time because of these invasions into the heartland of China. So I think I've run through everything on this list. I am write-up on time, but actually knew I have five minutes extra, Donna, I could do math. So I'm happy to take any questions about this to clarify anything for you or you can come to my office hours this afternoon as well. So called and asked that yes, that was that detail. That is the writing of the top of EJ owns portrait in the upper right corner here. So canon is a group of texts that get edited and promoted as the core group of, of, of, of tax. And it's sort of accepted as the correct text for a particular field of knowledge. So the canonization of the 50-100 texts reproduced as part of the Tripitaka Korea Anna, that certain other texts that weren't included get forgotten and left out of history because they're not reproduced as effectively as the ones that were included. So you have to think of any library as part of an editing process, as part of a group of choices made by the person putting them together to represent certain fields of knowledge and perhaps to ignore other fields of knowledge. And the choice in particular of these texts. For the Tripitaka, Cortana canonized those texts, made them more important than the ones that were left out. Any other questions I can answer at the moment? Alright, so this was the last of the lectures. For the next exam. We will have a review session for the next exam on Tuesday. And just like the review session last time, your response for that posting is required and needs to be in the day before. So that or I forget when I've set the deadline, but I've said it before class. You don't have a week to do that for this particular discussion because I need to know what questions you want me to answer in the review session. And if I don't have that information before class, it becomes a bit useless. So review these last six classes. Get brushed up on their information. Basically prepare yourself for the exam through that review process by Tuesday. And I'll give you the exam questions, van as well, so that you can prepare those. There are no more questions. I will Conan the class today. Thanks. I hope you guys have just curious whether Always Be An Essay on exams. I think it's worth while. I might exclude them from one of the exams. But it means you're not just sort of memorizing facts and ideas in a kind of blunt way which are able to use the ideas. So a short question will likely be on each exam. I am making the next exam open note, I'm experimenting with that. So that will be of help to you as well. In terms of composing your exam, essay questions and other information. Doesn't mean the multiple choice questions. We'll be a little bit more difficult than just date this object. Okay? I'll take care guys, have a good evening and I'll see you on Tuesday. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.


## [12. Porcelain](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/12-porcelain?module_item_id=2446628)
 Mm-hm. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Alright, let's go ahead and get started with class. As many of you have probably noticed, I haven't finished grading your exams yet. Many of you may have found it to be a tougher exam than the first exam. I hadn't intended it to be that way. I thought that OpenNotes would make it easier for you. And my corresponding shift in terms of the nature of the questions to make them a little bit more in depth, having more of the Multiple options available on the multiple choice. So you had to choose maybe three out of five in order for the answer to be a 100% correct. I thought that would give subtlety to the questions, but also within the open format or open note format. I thought it would still be quite manageable. It seems at least based on the other class to have finished grading. It's the same material based on their performance that we might need to rethink some of this formatting stuff, but I will wait for discussion on that to a later point. In particular, essays seem to be quite plausible to say all over the place. But again, I haven't finished your exams yet. Maybe this section did better collectively, but I'll try to get that done before next class, but that's no promises on that. At least by next. But by this Friday they will all be done. So you can look for your final exam grades by this Friday. Are there any questions about the exam now that we can we can answer about this last exam. You can go ahead and put that in the chat window if you like. I was just wondering if you were going to be some changes. What do you think they would be like? Yeah. I well, I have to think it through. I have to I think get a little bit of feedback as to what made the exam so much more difficult. I think it's the essay section that tends to pull people's grades down. But again, I haven't done the analytics to really understand what it was that, that made the exam that much more difficult, but will have some sort of a feedback discussion board where we can chat about these things. She'll be optional. But again, if you feel like the exam didn't convey your understanding of the material, that's where you'll be able to sort of engage with either constructive criticism of how to make the exam better. Personally, how you might be able to, to improve your own engagement with the exams. So I'll post a board probably after I finish going over all the exams, after I've thought about what it is that made them more difficult. And then we'll try and get some feedback from you guys that make sense. Okay. Let me just make a note that I need to poster board. Any other questions about the exam at this point or how you're doing in the course, etc. Again, this is just over the halfway point. Let's civil, we'll be having another short essay assignment outside of exams. If it turns out the essays weren't great, Mindy asks, there's still one more as say I'm that I, that I'd like to make do again, I started off with three short essays, the very beginning of the semester, and I've reduced it to two. And I think that's still necessary to have you at least learn from the way in which First essay went and how to improve on it. And again, we might have to do some sort of separate breakout discussion within one of these lectures where we talk about what makes for good art history essay. I thought the outlines would be enough. It turns out maybe that's not the case. And again, you can always come to my office hours if you specifically want to go over your essay. I've just come back to the first exam and I think I've opened it so that you're able to see what you got wrong and that exam, some could confirm for me that that's the case either during this exam period or at a later point, that would be great. But I think I've played with the settings so that, that, that's now open for you to see what you got wrong and your past exam. And I'll do that with this exam. Ok. Thank you, Lydia. I appreciate that. And I'll do that with this exam two, once I have everybody ironed out who had a sickness, illness, other sort of issues so that the exam is open for everybody to see. For those who haven't made may not have taken up. Alright, if there are no further questions, then let's get on to the sort of second to last block or module. In the class. We've looked at the sort of ancient period. We've looked at what we're calling the medieval period. And each time we've move through these, we've problematized adding those sorts of large historical brackets around time periods and how a lot of our time periodization really does come from western modes of writing history. And very modern modes of writing history sort of call this next section, the early modern period, very much engages with this kind of dividing up of time. This dividing up of historical periodization is one of the characteristics that we might think of, of the early modern period is an interconnectivity of cultures, not just regionally, but globally. And that's why several of the early modern lectures focus around certain kinds of material culture, such as porcelain, which is what this lecture focuses on. And the way in which objects like porcelain objects, perhaps more easily than religious sculpture, perhaps more easily than painting. Move across cultural and geographic boundaries to create visions of Asian culture in places like Europe. And later on in this module, we'll get to some of the ways in which that has been theorized says orientalism. But for now, let's start off just thinking about the materials that traveled over these larger expanses with increased trade and what we tend to think of as the beginning of the modern period, the early modern period. And we'll start with this image. This is a Renaissance painting by Andrea Montana. And those of you who have taken one at eight or any professor Casper courses in the art department may have encountered this painter. But we are thinking about it specifically within the exchange of porcelain and the traveling of Chinese and East Asian goods into Europe. So take a moment, look at this image. What's going on in it? This is basic, basically a kind of precursor of oil painting of distemper and which is a material for suspending pigment. And just like oil is oil painting on linen. And the I don't know why I get distracted by that. I'd take a moment and look closely at this image and ask yourself for what's happening here. Who do you think these six figures are? What gives you that information? And then what are they doing? Where's the center of the image in terms of action and attention? How do you know that? And what do you think? This is an image of? What is an image? A bout? And it can be about multiple things. So take a moment, do a little bit of constructive visual analysis and then respond in the chat window. And we'll get a discussion going about this European painting and why this painting from around 1500 painted in Italy, has anything to do with porcelain and East Asia. Oh, so one interesting thing to note right off the bat with all of your discussion is that you're very, most of you who come, especially with some sort of knowledge of Christian iconography, or very quickly able to identify what the scene is and who are the people in the scene. And you might want to contrast that just for a moment mentally with the way in which some of the imagery from Buddhism or the sort of Confucian imagery that we've encountered so far has been somewhat unfamiliar to you. That is, it's been less easy to identify what is going on. And again, this is about iconography and this is about the fact that many of you have seen a similar kind of composition before. Where you have three older men on the right, visiting a family on the left with an older man, a younger woman, and a baby who is intelligent enough or sort of gifted enough to as a child, be able to speak and offer gestures that seem to be meaningful. And as many of you mentioned, at just off the top my head, Colton and Julian had written about the halos. Many of you mentioned the halos that bracket the faces and the heads of each of these figures show that they are holy in one way or another. And those ideas of halos, you might even see a parallel with some of the Buddhist imagery. But we've looked at so far it with a big quarter called manned or LAS, or an almond shaped halo that sits behind the Buddhist figures. And there's almond shaped Mandela's or halos also. And the Christian imagery as well, especially Byzantine iconography of Jesus. So again, most of you were able to, through your knowledge of this store your cultural knowledge to bringing to this. And because of the iconography that's being repeated here from other representations that you've seen. You're able to identify this as Joseph and Mary and the newborn baby Jesus being visited by the three wise men who have, at least in the stories of the New Testament, seen a sign in the heavens, constellation stars and traveled from great distances to pay. Homage or respects to this infant child who they think will become a Savior, they think is the child of God. And in the book, in the Bible, as many of you said, the three wise men bear three different kinds of gifts, frankincense, MMR, and gold. And if you look closely, you can see that this piece of porcelain, blue and white porcelain, which is one of the reasons why we're focusing on it. In the front, has the gold in it. And the frankincense and the Mer, which are aromatics, are in these containers here. One made of it looks like an agate or another kind of stone and another possibly made of class. And so again, you're able to identify the six figures based on your kind of iconographic reading of them. Knowing what the story is initially going into, looking at this image. And at least one of you ad set in my quick notes that I jotted down Jackie mentioned for center of the image, right? If you're just talking about central axis, you get this axis right down the middle here that separates the holy family from the three visitors. And the axis across the middle where you are basically getting this gesture from Jesus and his two fingers that are kind of speaking gesture. And the, that is the sort of main action along the middle axis. But following their eyes is another way that the painter has sort of taught us where to be looking into. These wise men are looking up at Mary and Joseph. Joseph is looking across the Weizmann, but Mary looks down as does Baby Jesus at this particular wise men, The one who comes bearing the gold in the porcelain cup. And so the main focus really is on this interaction here. These are also the three figures that are in the foreground right there, closest to us as viewers. And so emphasis is given to what's happening between these three figures. And that's part of what answering this question of what this is about. So on the one hand, this is Christian iconography and this is about a Christian store, and therefore is about conveying these sorts of ideas that are coming from the new testament about the birth of Jesus and His Holiness and his recognition, recognition of his holiness. But there's another layer happening here that comes to when we think about these repartition representations of the Weizmann. So these three wise men represent circa 1500 the main trading partners with the Italian state. In which this is painted, you have the Ottoman Empire, represented by the man just behind the man in the foreground with the turbid on and the beard. You have the North African countries represented by the man in the back right corner also in the, in the background. So again, you have the Ottoman Empire or what we might think of as sort of The edge of the Middle East, Turkey. Basically, if you want a modern geographic pin, the northern African trading empires, which were both the enrich at this time and were highly influential and the trade around the Mediterranean area in which Italy is engaged. And then this third person here is meant to represent East Asian trade and exchange at this point in the Renaissance to an Italian audience. So an Italian audience circa 1500, looking at this image, would recognize these three wise men, you know, who are biblical figures and therefore are not associated with these modern, circa 1500 places. But they would recognize in these three wise men references to the present, references to the main trading partners of the Ottoman Empire, the North African princes in territories. And then of course, East Asia, which at this point has become a desirable location of, of trade, of, of exchange. You'll recall that our Indigenous Peoples Day, which was just yesterday, which was originally called columbus day. You'll recall that Columbus was set out initially before he landed in the Americas to try and find a trade route with the Indies and with East Asia. A quicker, more expedient and more profitable trade route than Around the Horn of Africa. And again, that's one of the reasons why in the foreground you have this figure here who is meant to can, meant, meant to represent at least to an Italian audience What a Chinese person, what would look like. Some of that comes from iconography that is specific to taoism. Actually, this figure here of John with the guardian of the North in Taoist iconography is shown as a kind of bald, long bearded figure. And early versions of this sort of Chinese Daoist figure would have made their way into circulation in the Mediterranean world. On and wave objects like the one being held by this person. So each of these objects also represents a kind of geographic commodity. And so while this is about, this painting is about the stories of the Bible, it's also about trade in the early modern world circa 1500. And the desirable, the most desirable trade, again with China, being that this is the center axis of the paintings composition. And the most foregrounded figure who was holding this blue and white porcelain object filled with gold. And so by looking closely at this Renaissance painting, we begin to understand how desirable trade was with China and how that came to be signified through certain kinds of objects like blue and white porcelain. And this brings us to some of our central question, specifically the second listed question here. What is the role that parse them play it? And global trade around the tenth century to the 18th century were picking it up toward the end it, with the image we started from. And we'll work backwards in this class to look at sort of the origins of porcelain and the spread of porcelain as one of these major early modern world commodities. So as I said, the painting that we were looking at was made circa 1500 as the European world was traveling via c, being deceived. And increasing the connectivity of the, of the Western world with the rest of the globe through these trading routes across the Pacific Ocean, down through and around the Cape of Good Hope and Africa and to the Indian Ocean, and then across the Atlantic as well. And we think about this seafaring exploration and trade as the opening at least of the early modern period. Particularly from a European perspective, porcelain had already started to come into the European worlds by land in and around the 13th, 14th century, largely due to the connection of the Mongolian Empire. And then porcelain began to be a major commodity traded across the seas. With the opening of the so-called age of exploration during the late Renaissance and early modern period in Europe. And the Age of Exploration again, is often connected to sea trade, which many of the initial sort of prime routes were established by the Portuguese from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, the bottom part of Africa, the African continent in the late 15th century. And then traveling all the way across the Indian Ocean to connect to India by the end of the 15th century. And it's of course worth while noting that this increased trade and connectivity not only brought cultural connection and the exchange of different kinds of commodities, whether they be spices or precious minerals or other ors, or objects like porcelain unless we're following it. But it's also the beginning of the colonial era. Where in many European countries, in order to establish better trade with these areas, dominating and occupying many of these areas, including the continent that, well, some of us are on right now. The Americas. This is the era of expanding sea trade, not only through government sponsored initiatives, but through some other. How to, how to put this other innovative styles of thinking about trade and exchange. Sorry, my brain's a little scrambled up the moment today. I'm trying to talk about our frame, the East India Trading Company, which were non-governmental corporations, the first corporations really of traders that came together to share the risk and also the profit of these trading explorations across the world and across the oceans. And this is another signal to many economists, beginning and many historians of the beginning of the early modern period, the development of these joint risk venture companies that weren't not entirely under the jurisdiction of the kings or queens of Europe. But we're separate. Trading Company is often selling parts of their company in share. So the beginning of the kind of corporation as we know it, is in these global trading companies, the East India Trading companies. And the Dutch is probably the most famous of the East India Trading Company and some will encounter them a little bit later in our exploration of the connection between Europe, China, and Japan. But there were English and French and sweetest Eastern new trading companies and even for a brief period, American East India Trading companies. But it was really the Portuguese that began the sea tray, this exploration connecting East Asia to Europe in more direct ways than the over route silk road that had existed before. Which was again, a set of sort of not a continuous erode necessarily, but a set of interlinked trading communities spread all the way across Central Asia. And within this explosion of exchange, porcelain was one of the most precious commodities. And part of that was because the Europeans didn't attain the basic technology to create porcelain until around 1700. So from the 15th century to the 18th century, you could only get porcelain by trading with East Asian sources. And this created high demand and limited access to this material which was highly valued. We tend to think of a direct porcelain trade between places like France, England, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands with China, and adventure with Japan. But as these trading routes expanded and as the new worlds, as it was understood from a Western perspective, was colonized. Many of those East early modern pieces of porcelain, especially the ones that are cracked and transport or were not considered viable for the European market or is valuable for the European market. Also found their way into colonial Spanish settlements. For instance, this fountain and sort of Brie collage, CO, collage of Portland's in Mexico City, which dates back to the 17th century. There's a combination here of tile made in Mexico, which was again at this point a colony. And East Asian porcelain that had been mixed in, that it come from the trade that went around the bottom tip of continent of South America. And so porcelain really is spread throughout the world by the 18th century through this sea trade and through the demand for porcelain, this technology that couldn't be reproduced anywhere except in East Asia. And again, we're sort of, we're working backwards in this class a little bit. Talking about the demand for porcelain in Europe for begin and think about what it was that made partial and special and different and made it something demanded. But let's look for a moment at our sort of tail end of our bracket here at the 18th century. And to kind of moment in which porcelain is being thought of as an object in high demand. But perhaps one that deserves ridicule and criticism. And let's look at one section of our poetry. I've given you poems from England in the 18th century and poems from China in the ninth century. So with this 18th century poem, how is China and how our hours porcelain being discussed particularly. And you can again, after reminding yourself of what the poem is about, just sort of toss it into the chat window. What does the poem tell you about China and porcelain by the 18th century in England? Mm-hm. Perhaps this is a harder question because the language is a little bit difficult, so poetic, right? So where do you see that? It says, is that you think that there's a fair amount of respect for the Chinese in their innovations in art and material. Where do you read that in the poem? The first four lines Eric cites of late to true, quite sick of Roman Greece. We fetch our models from the wise Chinese. European artists are too cool and chased for Mandarin only as the man of taste. And then as the rest of you are, are, are talking and then Drew's following up with the line, we fetch our models from the wise Chinese and Ethan is added. Porcelain is looked at as a commodity if that's of great value and representative Chinese culture and of innovation as an artwork as a whole. And so there's a cultural comparison that's happening here. But as Mindy ads, there is a bit of ridicule happening. And the painting here, which is about at the same time as the poem, this painting here is from 1743 by William Hogarth, who was a satire list for the most part. And the poem is supposed to be read as satire. And so you all right, in that the poem initially talks about the fact that rather than these neoclassical references to Rome and Greece in this moment in the 18th century, there seems to be this critically pointed out by the poet, an obsession with China. We fetch our models from the wise Chinese. Considering European art to be too cool to chase too removed. And for the Mandarin only as the man of taste that it's tastes has shifted to everything Chinese. And V, elaborate sorts of poetic lines here describing these gardens that had been built in places like England and France that imitated Chinese gardens with all sorts of exotic images and animals, as well as Indian. Sources as well. Everything was kind of mixed up and mixed together. And we'll talk about orientalism or this effect at a later lecture. But those last two lines while over our cabinets, Confucian, Confucius nods, myths, porcelain, elephants, and China. God's. One of the reasons I've chosen this particular image by William Hogarth is that you see all of these various intermingled Buddhists, Confucian and porcelain figures on this mantle in Europe with neoclassical models alongside them as, as well. And really by the 18th century, the fad for all things Chinese and especially porcelain decorative items had reached a kind of peak fervor, not only in England but in the rest of Europe. And this really be chins and his many ways symbolized by porcelain in particular. So the Montagnier painting we looked at from 1500, right, where you have the sort of beginning of porcelain trade coming into Europe as this highly sought-after kind of material and an object sees itself out into a mode of almost a ridiculous excess and images like this that described in this poem or that are seen in this, in this Hogarth painting. And that's one of the reasons why I've included CA, thorns of taste to show this sort of change from around 1500 to 1800 or so or 1750 in attitudes wherein even sort of mildly well-off middle classes could afford porcelain from China. And it was considered excessive. It was considered perhaps to be as, as is ridiculed by, by Katherine to be of a poor taste, to be obsessing over these foreign gods. And you can hear or an echoing here of kind of xenophobia that we talked about with the rise of Neo-Confucianism and the reaction against Buddhism within China as well. So let's backtrack a little. I started us off in 1500 with the obsession for things Chinese as seen even in biblical scenes. In European image, image, image making, painting in, during the Renaissance period. And in this poem where that sort of obsession with things Chinese and especially with porcelain objects as may be seen as being excessive. About where did this passion come from? Why this obsession with porcelain? Most of you, when you think of porcelain, this degree of exotic obsession is probably not the first thing that comes to your mind. You might think of very cute see, Chin C and sort of tacky objects like the, the basic porcelain figurines that you get at a Hallmark store or at the mall like the one that I've chosen here, you're the greatest grandma porcelain for most of us. Nowadays is a very common material. And it's very easily got. But again, in the early modern period, it was nine and was very highly valued. So let's take a step back and think about what is porcelain. And I'm going to show you this excerpt from a video made actually before all of you were born. So it'll look a little bit outdated and it's transferred from VHS. So it's got that quality to it, which I guess is back and style now what do I now? But this video is about porcelain production at Jing De Geng, which in from around 1400 to around 1800, was the major porcelain sites in China, in Southern China. And so let me see if I can cue up the video and share it with you. And what I want you to think about is where some of your key words come up in the discussion. Put forward in the eight or so minutes of this video that I'll show you. And to think about how complicated and intense porcelain production is. And we'll go over each of these keywords afterward as well. But first I need to share with you. Chuck jar. Sorry. Sometimes this takes a moment. I'm a little slow. They kept Goddess up here. But I think the volume is beginning to, China's emperor is ordered thousands of porcelain pieces from the January every year or use IP accord in Beijing in state rituals as an official or dining and for decoration. Another palace. In the heyday of the imperial porcelain workshop for more than 10 thousand specialists were at work. Their descendants continue that tradition. In modern Jing De John, which is still the center of porcelain production in China. Does is of workshops produce everything from inexpensive tableware, impressive display pieces, some quantity. Even with the introduction of modern technology, many methods, of course, loom production have not changed greatly since the days when Imperiali appointed supervisors coordinated a complex series of tasks required to produce porcelain. Porcelain clay is mixed to local materials. China's stone and Kaelyn. China's don't deserve granitic rock. Who's Chinese name means point brings. The China's don't mind. Active today are found within the sanbao mountains, are publishing Ajahn workshops. Today. Minor is used exclusively to extract if China's dome. In imperial times, the work was done by muscle power and hand tools. Mills on the river bank with 100 powered wouldn't those crush the rocks into a powder? Powder is mixed with water in large tanks, cleaned and impurities and formed into bricks. The white clay known as kaolin comes from gambling mountain. Teams of miners dig the kaolin and process it in a manner similar to that used for China's don't. Jing De Jun workshops and China's don't and kale and our pulverised again and mixed together with water, clean, then left to dry until the porcelain clay is the correct consistency. Workers need the porcelain clay by ten by hand until it is smooth and pliable and ready to be shaped. Years of practice lie behind the potters, seemingly effortless transformation of the clay into PESTLE shapes. Large pieces require a team of partners to shape and all the other artisans she millimeters of clay besides in rims that are partly Dr. vessels using specialized tools. And also carve faces home-cooked ranged from 1 after drying completely pieces and ready for decoration. And King to John. Most porcelain is, are decorated with designs painted directly on the hard clay with cobalt, which turns blue vector glazing and hiring. A colorless glaze is mixed group China's stone, bird limestone, and water. Specialists apply glaze to small pieces. I dipping them directly into the vat of glaze. Larger pieces are glazed by blowing the solution onto the piece through a two. It has a fine mesh on one end. This technique produces an even layer of glaze. After firing, a glaze will form a glassy coatings and protects the surface and adds a beautiful Lester. Sometimes glaze is used as the sole decoration. Mineral pigments can be suspended in the glaze to create a rainbow of colors, such as Read, made from copper. And two, the pieces had been glazed, unprepared, firing. Equalled containers made, of course clade called Sanger's. Porcelain is during hiring. A Sanger's are also made by specialists, etching to John. Firing takes place in a huge kill building bricks, workers, pile of towers of tigers inside the kiln. Carefully prearranged order. Once the sanctuaries are in place, the inference to the QM is sealed with bricks in the past and killed is that you require. Today, oil burning kilns have replaced the wood burning lines, except that this workshop, with a former method is preserved. Workers continuously iron wood into the kill as the temperature is slowly climbs to 1200 degrees centigrade. Workers that the imperial kiln did not have any mechanical devices to measure temperature. The kilns specialist gauge the temperature by watching the flames gradually turn from red to bluish white. There was little room for error. The success of the entire process depended on a proper firing. Prayers were offering to the kiln guide, or in a firing began. Mckeown is allowed to cool some white or it is empty. Workers still must wear gloves and having clothing to protect themselves from the hive. Sanger's supports Lindbergh complete at this point, but others receive additional declaration. Or his link designs on the glazed surfaces using brightly colored enamels made less and silica. Emperors placed orders for designs on Dragons, symbols of imperial power, and are oscillations designs of certain bars, fruits or animals, such as the crane, which symbolized immortality. A second firing at a low temperature in a small kiloohm. Mills enamels, an excuse them on the porcelain. The finished porcelain aren't carefully examined or flaws. In the past, workshops supervisors selected only perfect pieces to be sent to the imperial court. Even today. Pieces that do not stand up to the harsh inspections are immediately destroyed. Repair, repair to the bit error per the order from the Imperial workshop wasn't ready to be sent. I think that is enough of the video to give you an idea for the various stages of production that go into producing. I'm not sharing or thing, sorry. Producing just a single piece of porcelain. Here we go. And we're back to Microsoft PowerPoint. Good. So again, but that video was, was a video from the eighties. That's where you get some classic VHS scrambles across the screen and other sorts of kind of outdated styles, I suppose. Wide use these videos because it does preserve some of the older ways of making porcelain and shows you the various steps. Tau porcelain is produced at the specific site called Jing De Geng, which became from around 1400 on from the Ming in the Ming and Qing dynasties. The place where most of the world's porcelain was produced. And some of the other vocab words that came up that the China of stone as it was called This also called piton say, and the kaolin clay, which was described there as well. These two, the combination of these two materials make porcelain different than its counterpart, which we just call earthenware Pottery, as well as the kinds of glazes that go back on to it. Earthenware, pottery or just basic clay pottery, has fired at a much lower temperature and has very different feel and sound and transparency even to one of the things you might have noticed in that video was that some of those pieces of porcelain were so thin that light shines through them. You can't do that with earthen where like the kind of pottery we looked at from macho, Yeah. So one of the reasons why porcelain became one of these major desirable commodities in the world was because it was more durable and more shiny, more luminous than any other kind of earthenware pottery produced anywhere else in the world. And part of those effects come from the fact that the temperature in the kiln is much higher. And that the combination of these two different materials of kaolin, clay, which has a high degree of silicate content or silica content. And putting cell or kind of rock with a large amount of feldspar in it when you grind both of these two things up. But again, one is clay, it's mud, it's found in a river bed. The other is mind, right? It's a stone, it comes from a quarry or a mine. These two things have to be ground up and mix together at the appropriate combination. Sort of like copper, right? It's, it's almost like an alloy, right? In order to produce this material, which when fired at very high temperature is 1400 degrees Celsius, whereas earthenware pottery can be fired more than seven hundred, eight hundred degrees. These things, the clay, the silica content of the clay and the feldspar content of the stone as mix together fuse to create this crystalline structure that is much tighter, much thinner, and sometimes even transparent. Whereas your earthenware has none of that transparents. And you can see from the cross section here that even very fine earthenware as little bits of other things in it, right? Whereas these two purified substances, and you saw the purification process at the very beginning of that video, the washing, the sorting of these two things with water once there, ground up the stone and the clay produces this material that we think of as porcelain, which when you touch it immediately, cooler, lighter. When you knock it with your finger, it has a kind of chiming sound. If it's crafted, well, it's thinner, it lets light through. It has all of these qualities that make it a luxury item as compared to earthenware. And again, this technology, which is first produced probably around sort of the eighth century and China does not find its way to Europe until 1700. Which means that if you wanted these objects right, you had to pay quite a lot. Get them because of the amount of distance traveled from China to Europe and how difficult that, that path was. You could get a bowl that did the same thing in Europe or anywhere else in the world's made out of earthenware. But we're find porcelain with all these extra qualities, the sort of high tastes qualities was desired because it distinguished the person who owned them from someone who could only afford basic earthenware objects. So porcelain again is first produced in China ever around the year 750 or so. And its first produced in, in around. Zhang province. In the kilns, I jumped the gun on that factoid. One of the other two of the other things I wanted you to take from that video, let me pause the first creation of porcelain for a minute or two. The other things I wanted to take you from that wanted you to take from that video was how many steps there were and how specialized the steps we're into producing the final object right here at the mining, the refining of clay that producing bricks of those clay pieces you had all of Killen work that went in the shipping of things from the killing to the sites where they're painted and glaze and then they get reef fired and different kilns at lower temperatures. And so there's an extremely complicated division of labor at this site so that people specialized in just doing sometimes even one kind of detail for it, a circle that goes perfectly around the piece of porcelain in glaze, right? So you get a blue line that goes in a circle all the way around the rim. Perhaps you could specialize just in that particular aspect of porcelain production. And as the video said, tens of thousands of people were employed to produce porcelain at a place like Jing De Geng. Another thing that helps to create this technology was the use of highly specialized kinds of cones, which are sometimes called Dragon cones. Dragon comb is unlike to some normal calendar or specialized oven that, that gets to high temperatures to fire ceramics. In that it lies along a ridge up a hill. So it takes advantage of the draft, the way in which heat rises as it moves up a hill to produce extremely high temperatures, temperatures of 1400 degrees Celsius, at which you can finally fire porcelain so that it fuses. So there's two different materials fuse. So you need high division of labor. You need specialized technology, these two different separate materials. And you need this kind of cone, which can get to extra high temperatures in order to produce this thing, which is essentially a luxury version of your basic earthenware pots. And again, this begins or the earliest things we call porcelain that seem to produce with this method. Or from the Tang Dynasty in China and were made in the year kilns. And that's where our second object comes from. I was produced in Zhejiang Province at the FS site, the UAE kilns. And it was found not at those kilns, but in a site that you already know. The crypt at the bottom of the Pfam and Temple, which is the same place that are Buddhists finger bone rela query was buried. And one of the things we can conclude from that is that this porcelain bowl was valuable enough to be buried alongside the Buddha's finger bone reliquary along with other precious objects and goods in this crypt in the ninth century. And its particular bowl in the green glaze on it, which we call salad on a glaze. Was again found alongside the Buddhist finger bone rela query. And it was glazed with what was called the nice color of green salad on glazing. The reason we know that this glaze was the me, so are the secret colored green glaze is because there was an inventory of objects in the crypt of the farm and temple along with the Buddhist finger bone reliquary. And referred to these pieces of UA kiloohm porcelain as being glazed with me so or, or secret colored green. This particular color of green had been written about in documents from the Tang dynasty and onward. But this sort of recipe for it and the actual objects that could be identified as having this particular keyword Green, had been lost to history until this excavation after Fama and temple crypt where this porcelain was fountains labeled specifically as having this sort of nice or special cream colored porcelain glazing. And the broader green glazing that we identify with early porcelain in China. It's called Silva down glazing. And this is a special subset, this nice style of clothing and this green glaze in particular. And the porcelain that, that was, that it was, that a glazed was one of the sort of special attributes of porcelain in its early phases. And that's where we can turn to our second, two poems, which date from around the same time as this bowl was buried under the Pfam and temple at around 850 during the middle of the Tang Dynasty, again at the very early phases of porcelain production in China. And if we read these poems closely, we can begin to understand how porcelain was valued, not just for its kind of material properties, but the way in which metaphors added extra value to those material properties. So take a look at these poems and as quickly as you can because we will be running up on time for this class. I'm trying to identify ways in which this green glazed porcelain, this nice glazed porcelain was described in or by contemporary poets. So again, look to these two poems, end and see if you can find ways of understanding how porcelain was valued in China at around the time of its first production. Great. So all of you are picking up on, on, on, on this mountain range started us off with these metaphors, right? Like a swirl of thin IS holding green clouds. Jade like, like a green color and 1000 peak. So a lot of the metaphors are circling around the sort of various shades of green found on these poor salons. And As eric points out, this kind of metaphor we might think of as a, as a natural metaphor. Metaphors that relate the objects made by man to the natural world or in, in, in particular. And this is something we talked about with use of natural metaphors and calligraphy, or the use of the landscape in landscape painting, monumental landscape painting of the Song dynasty as a metaphor for human inter, interactions. And there was one more I wanted to get to hear. I think it was Lydia's related said skillfully molded like the full moon died with spring water. So you're getting an emphasis in these poems on natural metaphors that relate the objects to landscapes, to the reflection of light and moonlight in water or on do. And specific references not only to, to the sort of color metaphors, but the production of the object itself. And the first poem by Lou guillermo, You get the description of the kilns themselves at you. A killing site which is where portions are first produce. The autumn breeze blows and the UA kilns are lit. So you get this physical sense of the wind carrying through the kilns and them being lit up at this site where their first produced the kilns all over to capture the green colour of 1000 peaks. So think of that intensity of a metaphor, it, a color of a 1000 different mountains condensed into one glaze color. And then like a good poet, he asks you to take out your cups at midnight and collect the du or to drink wine. Like Ji Kang, who was a famous hermit from the Six Dynasties Period. In the second poem, you get references to the glazing and to the making of the ball, if a newly glazed and auspicious Jade like colors. So there's a metaphor, there's a sort of parallel being made there between. Color of green glaze and Jade hasn't material. Finish bowl was first offered to my lord, skillfully molded like a full Moon. Died with spring water. Definitely turned like a swirl of thin eyes holding green clouds like a mosque covered ancient bronze mirror present if this occasion tender, do soaked lotus leaf parted from the river's edge. So again, a variety of natural metaphors that are then embedded into other metaphors about historical figures and objects like ancient Bronze mirrors or Ji Kang who is a Six Dynasties Period, a hermit who like to drink. And so even early on in the production of this material and even just within its reception in china, porcelain becomes this object of high demand and desire for all of these qualities we just talked about, which are the result of technical innovations, but which Mark porcelain as distinct and have a higher kind of as a higher kind of luxury good than your basic other earthenware productions. And to the extent that poets are writing poems about porcelain, right? How many of you have written a poem about your coffee mug or the glass you took a drink out of most recently. This is how highly valued these objects were, even in their original production in China. But from this moment of early production around the eighth century began, we, when my earlier slides, I note that around 750 or so it was when we got the first kind of true porcelain. And then porcelain grazed, glazed with his green glazing that's called cell add-on. And even this highly refined version of salad on that's called the me sir. Our secret colored clays buried with the Buddha herbal and reliquary that were getting high value and high attention on this luxury good a porcelain. And that technology does spread within East Asia. Again, it doesn't get to Europe until 1700, but it travels throughout East Asia and first arrives in Korea around the ninth century through the other kinds of exchange that we've talked about with Buddhism, right? Trade, the movement of artisans, and the offering of goods across boundaries between these cultures that are collaborating with one another to create regional trade alliances. And then porcelain arrives. The technology to make porcelain arrives in Japan from Korea, but not until the 16th century. And so again, this kind of specialized material with combination of a stone that's refined and this clay that's refined and fired at very high temperatures doesn't make its way to Japan until the 16th century. And then it's actually a specific technology that video, she told me he or she who invades Korea at the end of the 16th century from japan, takes back with him. Or the Japanese army to take back with them after they've invaded career. And one of the things that we can take away from that little historical tidbit is the way in which porcelain is as a kind of commodity is so highly valued that the technology to make it itself is in demand in places like Japan where they haven't figured out locally yet. And so they steal artisans from Korea. In this attempted invasion of China, that happens at the end of the 16th century. And they bring these artisans back to Japan in order to create a Japanese porcelain industry so that they can profit from the same technology as well. Because by this point, as we've discussed, porcelain is in demand across the world. That's a rare luxury good that is produced first in China than in Korea, and eventually in Japan by the 16th century. And these goods are traded across Central Asia during the Mongolian period. And then of course by c, as we discussed during the so-called age of exploration of European expansion and colonization. T goods and specialized porcelain where we're even made for us, the Song dynasty emperors in China. Emperor who aids on who we talked about as this sort of highly refined, tasteful person who tried to cast himself as the ultimate Neo-Confucian. Literatus had specialized porcelain made for him at another site called the roof kilns. And he's spent time even describing how a teacup ought to be a certain color in order to emphasize the visual pleasures of looking at T. And this involved the production of highly specialized t wheres for the drinking of tea, something we'll get into in a later lecture. Up porcelain again travels across Central Asia through the Yuan Dynasty Mongolian connection and becomes a high demand commodity in places like the Ottoman Empire. In fact, the largest single collection of green glazed salad own wears solid on being another name for these green glazed wheres is in is Dembo at the tip copy Palace, which was originally part of the Ottoman empire. Over 3 thousand different Yuan and Ming Dynasty. Where's were acquired for the palace, for the Ottoman emperors. Because they were so highly valued. And myths grew up around them as well. The myth was that Ansel add-on, if someone tried to poison your food, the poison would be separated from the food. Just through the magical properties of the salad on ware itself supports link begins to gain this kind of stature and even sort of legendary stature as it's traded across the world, partly because of its rarity, right? Because the technology to make it has not been separately discovered elsewhere until later periods. One of the most commonly sort of imagined her thought of porcelain styles is the under glaze, blue and white contrasting style of porcelain which we associate with the late un in early Ming period. In particular, NAB, we've thought about Chinese pour some probably imagine something like this. And of course that's the style of porcelain That's imagined. I maintained in his 15, is painting circa 1500, this blue and white. Where an interesting fact is that blue and white where it was created as a style of clothing in the Yuan Dynasty in order to satisfy Middle Eastern demand for those designs. In the Middle East, in places like modern-day Iraq. Under glaze, blue and white wares were being produced with the less valuable earthenware materials. And when porcelain became in demand in the Middle East, blue and white designs were put on porcelain in order to serve Middle Eastern audiences and demand in those audiences for the same kinds of designs. But on this new material of porcelain. Porcelain is really the product of international demand by this point. And that is how we've thought about it from the beginning of our lecture, where we began with Montana and our poem about porcelain by the English poet CAFO. The traveling of porcelain to Korea, as I said, begins by the ninth century, just through the movement of artisans who knew how to make porcelain by combining these two separate materials and firing and at a very high temperature. And the styles of green glaze porcelain that because salad on, became associated specifically with the Goryeo dynasty because of the ways in which objects like this innovated upon earlier models from China and made them better than their original Chinese predecessors. Remember, we've already talked about the Goryeo dynasty in Korea as a dynasty that is highly aristocratic and that is focused on sort of court politics of these older aristocratic families. And that they're constantly allied with whoever is in control of the northern part of the mainland because that's where the border exist. And all of this information that you see here is repeated from our earlier Goryeo dynasty slides. So you don't have to take too much of this down if you already have that information. I'm just putting it here as a kind of revival of of that information to remind you what period we're at when we're looking at the arrival of porcelain technology in Korea through artisans that are traveling from these more war-torn sections of the northern parts of China into the safer, relatively safer places of the Goryeo dynasty on the Korean Peninsula. And they bring with them the know-how, the knowledge of making porcelain and this green glaze sell it on porcelain in particular. And remember as we discussed and as came up on your final, There was this emphasis on Chinese culture in Goryeo dynasty. Visual and material culture, as exemplified by the portrait of each AU and with his Chinese objects in the background. And the fact that he traveled to China to have this portrait done. So Chinese examples are in many ways valued by the Goryeo dynasty. But when it comes to porcelain production, the kinds of solid on that are produced in on the Korean Peninsula during the Goryeo dynasty are seen to Eclipse or surpass the things made in China at the same time. One of the sources that we have that tells us about this is the record of a Chinese Embassy or envoy to the Goryeo Court during the 12th century. In the record of this embassy to the Goryeo Court from the Chinese side of the author, shooting says that cell it on. There is even more rare than precious metals like silver or copper vessels or pots. And he writes that the Koreans have even surpassed the Chinese and the production of green glaze salad on where, where they have these highly specialized shapes and colors and undercut decorations. And the last object we want to deal with is one of those objects and object that is admittedly be even by Chinese sources during the 12th century, superior to Chinese green glazed porcelain. Where's the objects shaped has called him maybe on, which is a translation of a similar shape called a mapping or a plum blossom branch vessel. V is essentially in Chinese and this may be on conveys is different than our other cell it on where's that have ring that we saw produced in China. And I had wanted to go over kind of comparison to lay out those differences. But since we're right up at the end of today's class, I'll let me just cover those points. The main difference is the fact that there is this carved an incised undercut design with this alternating light cream color, black, and brown colors that are cut into the surface of the vessel after it's been dry it initially and separate colors of glaze are put in to those cut incised areas to produce these very detailed, very refined. Alternating glaze color patterns like here with the crane among the clouds. And this is done with such precision and such style that again, the Chinese viewers of the 12th, 13th century say that the Koreans, or even better if there's green glazed porcelain than we are. And that begets this question of origins, right? If porcelain and sell it on as originates in China in the eighth century, then is this something original? Is our Goryeo dynasty porcelain, not just derivative of this. Well, that's where we sort of moved to. This is just a recap of what I've just said. Sorry, I'm running out of time. So I'm just going to skip again as a recap of all the things I've just gone over about the traveling of solid on from China to Korea. And it's sort of changing there. It brings us to this idea of appropriation of the intentional borrowing, copying an adaptation of preexisting images for new cultures and purposes. And arguably this Korean salad on maybe on vase with its particular shape, the sort of high shoulder. Particular undercut designs with his contrasting tones and colors of clays is a new thing. Technology may have originated in China, but it suits different cultures and different demands and become something different and prized for its, for its own values as coming from it's Korean sources. And this idea of appropriation is one that we will revisit in later classes when first introducing it here. With the traveling and migration of porcelain technology across early modern world from China to places like Korea by the ninth century, but here in this 13th century example. And then finally to places like Europe. And by following the path of things like porcelain. Rather than paintings. Things, something we call material culture, right? Things that we might use in our daily lives up but which are decorated and of high value. Nonetheless, by tracing these objects, we can think about the transmission of certain kinds of artistic knowledge, how to produce porcelain, of visual motifs, like the kinds of floral designs that you see on this blue and white porcelain in the montane painting. Certain kinds of taste for refined see-through. Bowls and cups and vessels of certain kinds of framing devices. The ring at the bottom of the sort of lapped leaves, these medallions with cranes on them. As they travel from places like China and Korea to Europe, they might take on different meanings. And cultural understanding can be mapped across the ways in which these objects are received in various places as well. And so this is a kind of added zone or division of art history in which you don't study just the kind of high arts of sculpture and expensive paintings, et cetera. But you look at things that you might consider more basic like porcelain. To ask how we can learn about taste, cultural knowledge, and technical knowledge by following the paths that these things take across the early modern world. I'm sorry, I had to, I had to rush that at the end. I think I spent too much time discussing the test, the beginning of class. I, if there are questions about the material, please put them in the discussion board and I'll try to get to them. That's the end of class today. And I look forward to seeing you next class. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Thank you.



## [13. Architecture](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/13-architecture?module_item_id=2446630)
 Ooh, Mm-hm. Alright, let's go ahead and get started with class. First things first, I'm still not entirely done with your exam essays. There always a slog to get through. But I may have misspoke last class when I said initially that the essays for this particular section were disappointing, I hadn't actually started this section's essays yet. But my second sections, essays. Who's using them as a kind of general read on how well the essays had gone. I'd finished those when I started off last class. And those were quite disappointing in general for whatever reason, even though I teach the class exactly the same. This section did better on writing those essays. So good job. I'm still not finished with them. I intend to finish with them by Monday. And I will post the second of the essay prompts at that point as well. And then we might, before you start the essays, Discuss maybe how to engage your essays in a, in a better way. So all of that is forthcoming. Are there any questions about that at the moment and I will make your Exam two responses available to you, visible to you as soon as I can, probably at the beginning of next week as well. So any questions about that or about the rest of the semester as it sort of moves along, this point is often a moment of exhaustion in the semester and everybody has zoom and WebEx exhaustion as well. But thanks for sticking with me. I'll leave just a few more seconds for any questions that might have come up about, again, the rest of the semester about your exam, about the last essay, et cetera. So evans asking if their comments on the exam to essay, What I will do is send out an email with general comments about how the class did as a whole and where common mistakes were made, what an ideal essay would've looked like, etc.. And then you can compare your essay to that and try and understand sort of where you, where you may have fallen short term where you succeeded. And if you have further questions, what I would encourage you to do is come to my office hours, which are always just before this class or at the end of the day, beginning at 415. And again, if you absolutely cannot make those, which which means not, you know, you're out to lunch or doing something else, but you're now you have class conflict or our work conflict. Then you can email me and we can arrange another time to discuss it. You're always welcome to do that. But I don't give individual responses because it it would it would take weeks to do that. Any other questions before I move on to the rest of this course or this class. Alright, let's step into it then. So as you may have noticed, this module that we're in now starts off with three classes that are really about art forms and sometimes things that we don't commonly consider art forms. Through which we can trace the increasing connectivity of East Asia as an, as a region in East Asia with the rest of, of the world. This is the early modern sort of module when we discuss last class how porcelain circulated very widely, first in East Asia and globally during the early modern period. And today we are going to be looking at architecture with just a couple of examples of East Asian architecture, one from China and one from Japan. The Japanese example actually comes more from the medieval period. But looking at and contrasting, comparing these two things allows us to think about what some of the similarities are across East Asia architecturally, between different kinds of building sites with different kinds of purposes. And how architecture and its technology and its art form traveled across East Asia in the medieval and in the Early modern period. And the next class will move to something different entirely tea and talk about how tea culture is another way in which we can trace the transmission of culture across geographic spaces in the medieval to early modern period. So architecture, why don't we start off with just the basic compare and contrast. We're looking at both of these building sites from an elevated bird's eye view or perspective. And from that perspective, just compare and contrast these two sets of buildings. What similarities do you see? What differences do you see? And once you have a, go, a concise answer, go ahead and throw that in the chat window and we'll begin to discuss these two primary objects for today's class. Mm-hm. Whoa. Oh. Ooh, great. You guys are honing in on some really interesting details and some really fundamental things that differentiate these two buildings. There's a lot of you mentioned, there's an outer perimeter wall, the kind of sections off both of these spaces from an outer city or an outer town beyond and demarcates the kind of inner and outer relationship and the limits of this particular architectural setup. I think Lydia and air kind of snag that first. But a lot of you guys discussed that from this perspective, right? It's hard to understand kind of how you move through each of these spaces individually. But as a whole, what a lot of you guys were noticing was that the scale is quite different, right? So I had JSON and brackets and writing about this, the group of palace is on the left, is a much larger complex of buildings than the smaller group of four buildings with an outer perimeter sort of wall. And you can walk along for the temple at the right. And you might begin to think from this sort of basic observation. Just fundamentally the number of people that can fit in and interact with each of these spaces therefore, differs, which might relate to the purpose. And Jenny brought up the idea that, you know, she knows the one on the left is a group of Palace. It was right, and that it's a specific kind of building, a building where the imperial family resides, among other things. And we'll talk about that as the lecture moves on. Whereas the buildings on the right are, and she suggested they looked more modern but actually older. But they are Temple structure. And so the purposes of each of these buildings is going to dictate what kinds of relationships exist in the building site and how the buildings relate to one another, how the building's shape, human interaction to specific kinds of events. Whether they're religious or they have to do with the imperial family and the government. And along those lines, One thing that at least I saw a couple of folks talk about Zack and Mindy. Was this symmetry right? Mindy talked about how along the center line of the buildings on the left, you'd have this sort of largest buildings that are all on that central axis. Whereas in the building on the right, there's a central axis between that sort of front gate house and the back lecture hall. And then to the left and the right, there are buildings separated off of that center axis. Each have different heights and scales, but the buildings, the main buildings don't seem to be along that center line, even though there's the basic symmetry left and right that, that's happening and both building sites. Let's see. Are there things that people notice? Ryan and John talked about the colors and a lot of you did as well. The basic color scheme and the buildings on the left. But the imperial palaces in Beijing, the walls are painted red and the roofs have tiles on them that are glazed yellow. Whereas in the building set on the right, roof tiles are all a really dark blue color, almost a black blue color. And the colors are, they do have symbolic significance, which we'll talk about a little bit, but not to a great degree. And so that immediately might tell you again what purposes, or at least a difference in purposes between these two kinds of buildings. The yellow roof tiles within Chinese architecture usually denote places where the emperor lives or, or, or exists or imperial sites. So that golden yellow color. It's associated with imperial interaction. Whereas the buildings on the rights are not from China and there not for imperial use. And to have a different darker blue color on the tiles. And then Gabby notice that there's water or remote surrounding the buildings on the left but not on the right. And a large group of lakes on the left side as well. All of those water features are man made and they're actually important for the building site. As we get into the lecture, we'll talk about why that is. Again, just for basic visual analysis in comparing these two sets of buildings, we've seen that there are several kinds of similarities, right? The symmetry, the basic structure maybe of the buildings that were there. They have roof tiles and outer court, outer walls that differentiate it from the space surrounding it or each building sites from the space surrounding it. But there are major differences in terms of the color scheme, the scale, and the purposes of these buildings. So as we move into the lecture, keep those things in, in mind as we begin to answer our R and broad questions for the class. So if we apply our one of our first broad questions to this first site that we're going to talk about, the Forbidden City in Beijing. What does the architecture of the Forbidden City tell us about the ways in which the space might have been used. Before we break that down, a little bit of background information will be useful. We're moving into a different dynastic period in Chinese history. You'll remember that the last time we were in China was during the Yuen dynasty period, appeared where foreign rulers conquered all of Japan. And we talked about the effects of the Yuan Dynasty Mongolian rule over the majority population of Chinese. Toward the end of the Yuan Dynasty. As civil war breaks out, there were a variety of different rebel factions fighting against the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty administration. Excuse me, I've got allergies at the moment. And the victorious sort of faction that ended up reconquering the rest of China. Began really in the southern heartland of China in and around Nanjing and established a new dynasty. A new dynasty there. At the beginning part of what was done named the Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty rulers were Han, ethnically Han Chinese again. So a period of rule that now returns to the majority ethnicity group or ethnic group in China. And the first emperor of this newly established Dynasty, the Ming dynasty, gave himself the imperial re name of WHO and had quite a long initial rule, given that what we had quite a long initial rule period, about 30 years. These dates here, not his life dates, but his reign dates, which I should have made more specific. And since his rebellion really began in the southern heartland area of Nanjing, that's where the first capital was established. He lived for so long. That's when it came to deciding who would be the next emperor. He already had grandsons that were sort of eligible age and he skipped over his sons in favor of one of his grandsons who had been the son of his preferred successor. So the second emperor, Emperor genuine was actually the grandson of the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty. And he inherits the throne. But as you can see, he only holds on to his life and power for about four years. This is because of some juicy political scheming that goes on. And in particular, the fact that his uncle, who was the son of the first emperor and was stationed in the north I in Beijing to hold down those territories that had just been newly conquered in the Ming Dynasty. His uncle was upset at the fact that his nephew became the Second Emperor and thought that the title of Emperor ought to go to him. And so he stages a sort of coup of revolt, supposedly to rescue his nephew from corrupting officials in the court, which had been established in the South in Nanjing. And in that rescue attempt, his nephew mysteriously dies in a fire that consumes the whole palace complex in the south in Nanjing. And when the Emperor, second emperor and his whole family parish, guess who the throne goes to. It goes to this general of the North, the son of the first emperor, who gives himself a new reign name of your law. So he becomes the third emperor of the Ming dynasty because his power base was in the north. That is where his armies were. That is where as political sort of base was. He moved the capital. They're from Nanjing. So Nanjing, the capital for only two Emperors reigns in the Ming dynasty before the capitalists moved north to Beijing, where it remained until the present, the present day. And so the modern capital of Beijing has its roots in this transition, where the third emperor kills his nephew in order to take over the throne and become the emperor himself. The capital of Beijing had previously been the capital under other dynasties though, especially these Northern Dynasties during the Yuan Dynasty. And this is where the emperors established their capital. Remember the title of the capital at this point was not Beijing but DOD tool or that the grand city, I guess with the grand capital. And in the previous Dynasty that had ruled over the North. Remember there's the, these northern invading dynasties, the Jin and the Liao dynasty. They had established capitals in what's now modern Beijing as well. And this map shows the various capital complexes under each of these dynasties. The Liao, which had a different name for the capital, they called it Nanjing custom. Liao people. This was actually a southern location. Which gets a little confusing. But just know that in the modern city of Beijing there all these foundations still, if you excavated them archaeologically, of these prior dynasties capitals there including the Liao dynasty, the Jin Dynasty, which gave the name to this capital of Zhongdu. The UN walls, which can be seen here in the yellow. And the name of the capital that point was dot do. And then finally, the outer city walls of the Ming and Ching capitals, the last capitals of the imperial period in China. And our Forbidden City is marked right at the middle here. And this is the city. And the group of palaces that begins to dip that the third emperor, Emperor you'll love the Ming dynasty begins to build there and which to this day are still a major historical sites, still largely intact from their early Ming establishment. I see a couple of questions. Why the imperial palaces called the Forbidden City? The Forbidden City is, is more of a name that comes from a kind of Western imagination. Partly because you could only enter into the Forbidden City If you were of a certain imperial rank. And then you could only enter into a certain inner court or section of the Forbidden City if you were part of the imperial family or serving the imperial family. So there are several sort of names to this space in Chinese and in English. But we can consider them that the palace, the palace as the imperial palaces is probably the most generic name for these. Christine asks, what's the point of changing capitals? When the dynasty leadership changes? It can sometimes cause more conflict and confusion. But again, the third emperor, Emperor Yang, when he moves the capital north, is moving to where his armies and his political base, R. And as we've talked about in this bin, these previous periods, right? The northern, the defense of the Northern boundaries of China was always one of major concern. So it was militarily strategic to have your capital further in the North because you could pay closer attention to the Northern boundaries which, as you know from this course, had been invaded at several points in the recent history. In the UN dynasties of China and the Jin Liao, which were conquering parts of the North during the Song Dynasty, which existed in the South. So again, all sorts of little geographic shifts in manipulations and wanted to sing. One of the things this goes shows that our current conception of the geographic boundaries of China constitutes China really at its broadest and largest expanse. But at different moments in the history of China, especially in the imperial history, not all of that space was under Chinese control. So right, moving along. So that when the Emperor, Third Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor you'll low moves is capital up to the north. He begins construction of his own palace complexes, which are modeled initially after the palace complexes that had existed in the South in Nanjing, the where the first palaces of the Ming Dynasty were. But when the young Emperor, the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, makes his new capital in the north expands on that plan. And quite a lot of labor and man hours went into. The production of this, of this palace complex. The construction begins soon after. Yong moves is capital to the north. And the initial construction period is about 15 years. Before anything had to be before anything could be constructed in terms of buildings, the Foundation had to be laid for the site and had to be leveled with a slight, of course, boring outward to the sides so that water and runoff would move toward the moat. And the ground underneath the Forbidden City. I had to be specially prepared for drainage and for a variety of other reasons. So at the very base of the Forbidden City is ground up rubble, basically broken rock and earth, et cetera. That has been pounded down and compacted. And on top of that, there are layers of fire bricks which helped to create better not insulation, but what am I thinking? A better kind of runoff for storms and other kinds of meteorological events. And then on top of those five layers of clay are more pounded earth and more layers of clay. And this was done not only for practical reasons, but also because it's supposedly sealed off the Earth from evil spirits that could come up under, underneath. So the whole ground had to be specially prepared and sealed and compacted to create a proper building site within the norms of Chinese architecture. Of the buildings, for the most part start with timber construction. That is, they're made of wood. And most of the wood was sourced from the southern regions of China, which meant it had to make its way all the way up to the north via transportation systems like the Grand Canal. The stone for the Forbidden City, for all the paving stones and for the large pieces of marble over which the emperor was carried, or all quarried in mines that were 30 miles away, and marble and granite mines that were quite a distance away. The larger slabs were so big that to transport them, you had to wait till winter and the road was iced so that the large slabs can be carried along the ice with rollers and slit more or less 30 miles to the capital. And it's estimated that the construction of this pole palace site in the early Ming Dynasty, up to 2% of the total population, one in every 50 people was somehow involved in making the palaces. Whether they were people querying at the mines, producing the tiles for roofs, or harvesting the hardwoods in the South. A large percentage of the population was conscripted for the production of these palaces. Supposedly there were 9,999 rooms, one less than the number of rooms in the heavenly Buddhist paradise. There aren't actually that many rooms and I don't think a full account of the rooms isn't necessarily been been done. But what that points to in this sort of idea that's put forward that there are one less than 10 thousand rooms is that this is a kind of place where the person who was closest to the heavens, the emperor, lives right? There's just one room short of these heavenly palaces. The total geographic space that the pallets takes up is over 37 acres. That's many, many football fields. And for any of you who might have been there yourself, it is exhausting to move through the whole of the space when you're taking a tour or when you're, you're visiting. And the palaces, just as you saw from the last slide, are at the heart of the city wall and the heart of the larger city at the exact middle of the city. And symbolically therefore at the heart of the empire as well with concentric circles moving out from the moat around the Forbidden City, which is dug out and intentionally place. They're both as a kind of defensive mechanism. And as we'll find in a minute for more auspicious reasons, and the rubble that's been dug out there has been PUT north in what's often what's called Coal Hill. This little hill that is at the northern edge of the Forbidden City beyond the moat. All of that material was once in the earth here and was dug up and reposition to this space to create the moat. When you're moving through the Forbidden City, just as you guys noticed from the images, there is a kind of order along the central axis, a central line. And the buildings become bigger as you move to the center. And we'll talk about that in just a minute. So the center axis here, the largest building, is this building here, the Hall of Supreme Harmony. At the exact center. Well, not the exact center, but at the center of the Forbidden City, and it is also the highest and largest building. So the size of the building tells you where the most important buildings are. And there's another element that helps you, as we've size and scale weren't enough. And that is actually the roof decoration. And we'll get to that as the lecture goes on to focusing on that particular aspect of how it is that buildings identify their importance. So as I said, and as you notice senior visual analysis, there is this central access to the Forbidden City that moves north to south. And there's the moat around the Forbidden City. And within the Forbidden City, there are actually two sections as well. There's the Outer Court and the Inner Court. The Inner Court is furthest in along this axis that that she moved from south. North. And the inner court is where the imperial family lived. And the only people allowed access there for most of the history of the Forbidden City. Where the servants and members of the royal family, or is the Outer Court, was used for governmental purposes. For the emperor holding court, for audiences to be met, for certain rituals to be held at the beginnings and midpoints of seasonal ritual events in, in the city. And again, the architecture reinforces these spatial separations and the way in which, again, the outer court and the inner court differentiate themselves by purpose. And you can tell just from looking at it from this aerial point of view, that in the background you get a lot more of denser groupings of small buildings and these little courtyards or where different members of the imperial family lived. Certain princes and princesses and queens and wives of the emperor. I'll had different sections of this sort of back area. Or as a larger front area of the outer court has much broader open spaces in a feat and a fewer number of larger buildings because they're meant for governmental purposes, for large audiences and for the functioning aspects of the emperors role in the government. Here's a Ming Dynasty painting from the 16th century that shows officials at the beginning of the day sort of making their way through the various gateways. Again, along this sort of central axis, here is moving from the bottom of the painting upward into the Forbidden City. And this was painted for high government minister. And in a way to kind of honor the fact that he has access to the palaces as part of his job. And it shows the outer city wall gate called the Chen Min. And moving through a series of gates along the center city axis, all the way into the Hall of Supreme Harmony, which is the furthest into court that an official might get. Because beyond that would be the private palaces of the emperor. And hear from the aerial perspective are several of these gates. So the Gate of Heavenly Peace, Tiananmen, which for most people, as you're driving through Changjiang, sort of major road that cuts through the middle of the city. Looks like the beginning of the Forbidden City. But this is so all outer, outer, outer city spaces. Once you reach the Meridian Gate, shown here, this larger U-shaped building that is elevated on large stone bases and is sort of an imposing building. That also demarcates the edge of the moat. That's when you're moving into the into the Forbidden City itself. Then there are these outer spaces here and we'll talk about the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the main central audience hall, and the largest building in a complex, as well as the highest building in a complex. And then where does painting Ns is naturally where officials sort of and their entrance into the Forbidden City and what's beyond these little palaces here are just imagine because they're the private spaces, the emperor and the emperor's family. So if you're moving from these outer city walls of Beijing, this is what that central axis looks like. Fair. Our modern pictures below on the left here is our aerial view that we've been working with. And here is a 17th century Ching Dynasty painting that shows a procession along each of these sort of barrier points that are all positioned again on that central axis. That not only dictates the entrance to an interaction with the Forbidden City, but with the city at large, beginning with this gate, which is right along that axis, which is the outer city wall gate or was the outer city walk eight at this time called Chen Min, the front or for gate. Here you can see a procession and imperial procession arriving back to the capital, beginning from the south and moving through that major gauge. And here is the slightly reconstructed version as it exists today in Beijing. So if you follow this line straight through, you can end up right in the middle of the Forbidden City. As you move along that central axis, you pass through the Tiananmen Square, where currently the mausoleum to Mao Zedong and the People's Revolutionary monument exists. The National History Museum is over on this side. And the national opera and symphony hall is over here on this side, having only been constructed relatively recently. But all of this again is on the central access with an aligned by the architecture of the Forbidden City. And as you move into the Meridian Gate, here's a picture circa 1900 or so. Again, all of this you can see through each of these doorways to the sort of gateway beyond is aligning you on this central axis to the emperor. And once you move past the set, the set of gates, we've just talked about the Heavenly Peace gate for the court of the Tiananmen Square. And through the outer gate of the wall, the city wall, you meet the official kind of barrier to the Forbidden City itself, the Meridian Gate, the central gate. And this really divides the Outer City from the court. And as our painting, which we've been moving through. Shows us this is where again, the sort of, you would meet the emperor on his way back into the city from one of his tours through the empire. In here are all of his officials, the military and the civic officials. And they're red and they're blue uniforms lined up to receive the emperor at the Meridian Gate. Here shown from the east and here shown from the South in a, in a photograph. And again, you can see these fortified under sections to this gate market as a kind of a military defensive mechanism as well. There's sort of fortified here with palaces on top that mark the Outer City from the Forbidden City, the city from the court at large. And if you look closely, there are five doors here, so five different possible ways of entering. You can see that in the painting. Here's the central door. To the left and the right are other doors. And to the far left and this wing, the West Wing of the gate, and hidden here in this image, but visible in the photograph. In the East Wing of this gate are smaller doors. And you can only move for these gates if you had obtained certain ranks. So if you move the central axis is of course, the most important gate. It's the biggest and the highest, which you can see in this photograph. And therefore the most important. And that's the access gate that the emperor used. To the left is where the imperial family were allowed to enter various princes and princesses and wives, et cetera. And the high officials, Thai government officials moving into business at courts with the emperor would move in through the write gate to the very far left. Here in the image you can see here this is where military officials would move in and then civil officials would move in from this gate. And so there's a hierarchy of access that's, that's denoted here by these different doors that you could move through. With the emperor of course, being the central axis of both the empire and here at the gate. So the Meridian Gate is really the access point. And it helps to divide again the hierarchy of people who have certain kinds of access to the, to the court and to the emperor. As you move along that gate from the Meridian Gate through a series of other buildings. The highest building, the Central Building of the entire Forbidden City, which is the most elevated. The largest, it has the largest number bays in terms of these spaces between the columns at the front of the building as the biggest roof. This is where the major court events were held, including the ritual that welcomed in the new year of so-called Spring Festival, as well as the Mid-Autumn festivals, various other public rights that the emperor was expected to conduct. And it's framed along again that central axis, which we've been following all the way from the outer city gate. And then with a large, as you can see from the aerial perspective, a very large open square around it. And that opens Where could hold up to 20 thousand different subjects who would attend four major rituals and proclamations, et cetera. And again, if the elevation didn't give you an idea that this was the most important. If the fact that it's again on that central access didn't give you that idea. If the fact that it didn't have the largest number of bays and didn't have these large marble. What am I calling is not patios, but sort of terraces outside of it didn't let you know that. There are other little signs too, like the fact that it has the largest number of brackets and the largest number of roof ornaments. And these little architectural details denote importance. And for the roof brackets they once had a kind of function. Will talk about that a little later in the lecture of elevating and supporting the roof off of the beams to give it a greater height and length to the roof and the roof eaves. And these figures along the roof liner sort of protectorate as well. They're seen to ward off a fire or calamity that might befall these buildings. So again, the architecture of the city, the axis of the city, the size and the ornamentation of the building or all telling you where are the most important events are, as well as the spacing around it, right? This giant open space is meant for giant ceremonies for important events. As you move past. This though, this is where access changes and we're purpose changes. And as you move over and beyond the Hall of Supreme Harmony, you move into this little back gate, Gate of Heavenly Purity. And from this point onward, the Outer Court were all imperial. Events are happening, all sort of public facing events are happening. And then into the inner court, which is the private residences of the imperial family. Get along that central axis. You may have noticed that there are these long large pieces of carved stone with dragons chasing pearls among clouds and over mountains. And the Emperor was carried over these sculpted central carved stones with his bearers that people holding up his sedan chairs, walking down these little steps to the left and the right. So he was always suspended and floating over the central axis. And again, as we move past the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the buildings get smaller again and you move into the private spaces of the emperor. And that is the division between. The outer functional bureaucratic space. So the Forbidden City and the inner private spaces. So some of these private spaces, this is the largest building in the inner courts, the Palace of Heavenly Purity. And these buildings shifted function sometimes within dynasties and sometimes between dynasties. So during the Ming Dynasty, when this whole complex was first constructed, this first large building was actually where the emperor and his queen slept and where the family sort of lives. During the Qing dynasty. That was not the case. This is the space where death viewing writes happened where certain rituals that the Ching dynasty emperors partook in that were different from the Ming dynasty emperors were those were held and sometimes where even state affairs were held. Whereas in the Ming dynasty that was always in the outer court. So that the functions of these buildings over time shift, which slightly changes the architecture. But mostly we know about these shifting functions through our various court documents that tell us where kinds of events were held. These inner courts were the space, again of the imperial family and the servants who made the imperial palaces function. That included at the height of the imperial cities population over 2 thousand Unix and 200 to 300 ladies in waiting to the various princesses and emphasis. The reason why the palace is served by Unix, which are men have been neutered, is so that there was never any question about where the pregnancies per various queens and princesses came from. The inner court is not just a group of residential palaces. There were private studies for various emperors, sometimes high at the highest level of government officials, like the Grand Council members, are allowed into somebody's private studies to converse with the Emperor. There were also private gardens for the pleasure of the imperial family with various flowers and trees cultivated to create a sense of nature within the Forbidden City, as well as private temples for warship, for the imperial family as well. So that's given us the kind of walk through and just through a kind of visual analysis in and virtually kind of placing ourselves in the Forbidden City. We can understand where certain kinds of boundaries exist just through the way the architecture is organized, through the way in which the space is organized. But there are a variety of other Ideals that underpin the construction of the Forbidden City there, maybe slightly less visible to those of us today. And so that's where I want to turn to our reading, which is a strange sort of reading. Probably you found it bazaar and hard to follow is just the first two sections of a 15th century carpenters manual. And one of the reasons why I've chosen this taxes, because our building site, right, begins in the 15th century as well. So I want you to take a moment now and stop listening to me babble. And look at your reading which is posted here. What according to this carpenters manual, again, you're looking at the very first chapter is What are the first things that are considered important when a site is built? Why do you think these are the first things that are mentioned? And how does that contrast with your own ideas about what's important for a building site. You're sort of modern ideas. So take a moment, reread these, and then try and answer these questions in the chat window and we'll discuss them as a subgroup. Let me see if I've missed any questions. So Caleb, and ask, does it move north or south or south to north? Always south to north? Yeah. Mm-hm. It's him who might be met with a bit of a silence on this question is probably very strange to you, but make an attempt to understand what's going on in them and why we might be talking about them if you can. Right? So a lot of you are hitting on it. So whether it's let's see if I can get some names that are I didn't write any down. Let's see, Christina Murray, ban and several others of you really focused on Kristina, et cetera, that sort of supernatural aspect of this text, right? And kind of superstitious set of priorities which governs when you can even begin to chop down the trees that eventually get used to build any of the given structures that create a temple. And so these are the very first things that need to be considered according to this carpenters manual, whether you are angering goes, whether you are choosing an auspicious day to failure trees which will have consequences for the building that you build. That bad juju will end up creating problems for the building. But a building site and the people it. And so we're getting a lot of supernatural and superstitious sorts of priorities right at the very beginning of this carpenters menu on. And that may seem strange to us. What we might connect it to some of the other kinds of very deep cut ideas that we've dealt with in terms of sort of Chinese thoughts. Going all the way back to sort of ancestor rites and rituals and the predicting of the future that was inherent. To those rituals and rites, The Book of Changes, again, one of our core classics of Confucian thinking, not at all written by Confucius, but it's all about divination, right? About predicting the future. And those ideas, those superstitions make their way into a variety of different kinds of professions, including architecture or carpentry. And carpentry and architecture or weren't really sort of thought of as separate professions at this point. Your Carpenter, your Builder was the person who put together your building for you. So the modern idea of the architect being a kind of creative designer. Hat didn't have a lot of play. At this point. More architecture was much more of a kind of functional or technical skill set. But as, let's see, Matt, I think first started us off some of these aspects of the direction in which you point the trees. How many trees you fell at a time, and how you think about the layout of your year. What am I thinking? Your lumber site actually have practical applications as well. Like when you chop the trees down, you should stand them on a level place, right? Otherwise, they roll downhill. You might crush several of your, of your workers. When you're piling things up at the work site, you have to pile them in a certain direction. This might have practical consequences, but it seems to be largely governed, at least in this text, by something called the Yellow current, or the days of the eight thrones of the emperor, of the Great Throne Of the nine heavens. And this sort of Numeral logical way of thinking about which days are good and which days are bad, right? As the second section tells us, good days for chopping down would the sixth, the seventh, the eighth, ninth, 11th. And this is within that 60-day cycle of days. These are all good days and there are governed by these certain celestial stars, right? The bright star, the yellow path, the virtue of the moon, various kinds of constellations. So its correlation with the earthly realm and the heavenly realm has, it's kind of symbolic resonance in something that we might consider a very practical skill set right, chopping down wood to make buildings. And this is part of a larger group of concepts that you might have heard of actually as Feng Sway, right? Which is literally the winds and the, and the waters, right? That says what it translates to. And many of you have probably encountered foam tray in terms of apartment design or other kinds of more faddish uses of the idea. In the contemporary moment. The roots go all the way back to again, being able to predict the future for the outcome of whatever activity you're engaged within. If it's building, you want to make sure you've picked a good site to build on and that you've got materials that are not going to be cursed. And the idea that the material might be cursed sometimes does have a practical roots. Ripe. Lang things on a level ground is just a practical thing to do. So the idea of these mean malevolent in evil spirits that will come into your life if you choose the wrong day or if you choose the wrong kind of would sometimes have their roots in very specific and practical reasons. But this word function where you might generally think of under an English translation of geomancy, right? Of looking at the omens or predicting the kind of sort of auspicious ness of the materials on the site. As well as looking at the practical details of say, the topography of the site. How is water going to run off into your building site when it rains? Are you protected from invasion, from stagnant water, et cetera, things that will cause problems for crops and for living, right? And so all of these aspects are fundamental to even beginning the building site of places. As simple as a person's home, or as public as a temple or the Forbidden City. And one key aspect to geomancy or Feng SRE is picking the first site so they can the carpenters Menos starts with picking the right wood and chopping down the wood on the right day. It's an arranging it in the right ways. Another aspect further into this text talks about picking the right location. And again, the right location can have, it can be very practically oriented, or it can have a kind of more of a superstitious angle to it. So one of the more superstitious signs that you have to avoid, if there is a rock that resembles a toad and the grass looks like rice sprouts, then weird things are going to happen in your house according to this manual, cripples and hunched backs will be born and the sons will have an ugly appearance. All things that of course, hinder your ability to marry off your children into other families and to prepare your children for bettering the family name. And so here you have this little picture of this toad in auspicious, towed and these sprouted grasses that will give you bad luck if you build a site there. So you have to avoid those things at all cost. As for the toad rock, you know, who knows where the sort of roots of that superstition come from. The grass might have very practical routes though, right? The fact that the soil is not what is given. To produce better grasses that you only get crab grass or ugly grass. There. There are a variety of other sort of more larger scale issues when it comes to citing or choosing the correct site as well. So here's an image of how it is that you set capital down, write a capital city. Where do you choose to lay a capital city? And here you can see a kind of diagram of the city wall around the palace. And the choosing, reciting of that space with water that goes all the way around three sides and a mountain to the north. And these are considered auspicious omens, but also practically for defensive purposes, proper siting for the capital city itself. And you can see that those principles are more or less followed in the Forbidden City as well. Emote is dug around it. Again. The flow of water around the city. And a larger lake has been dug out whole high in Chennai, the sort of lakes of the capital in the inner city to the west and to the north, a mountain has been constructed. Remember that this mountain is not actually a natural feature. It is the product of all of the dug out material excavated from around the moat to create auspicious topography for the Forbidden City itself. And so you can see the Forbidden City is following these principles of citing a proper geomancy that have their roots. Again, in sometimes very superstitious reasons, but sometimes for practical reasons in terms of defensiveness of the site to attack or invasion. So let's move on to our second piece. Let me see if there's anything in the, in the chat window. What would they do Monday as in auspicious days that they couldn't continue construction. They probably prepare the wood and although it needs to be planned and organized, but that's just a guess on my, on my part. Trees are important. Our architecture begins. A lot of it has to do with building details, right? That's great. Consequences. Colton asks to choosing the wrong day or et cetera. Consequences may not be immediately tangible or obvious. But again, superstitious aspect there is that even if there are no sort of direct consequences to these actions, mike, down the line, create bad or in auspicious events in the place that you've chosen to build or in the site or the building itself. So again, you started off comparing these two sites and you made a lot of really great observations about how these two sites are different. We've just looked at the functioning of this site. How about how moving through it tells us how it's used. About adding some as to how adding some historical information tells us how the site got to be here. And how thinking about things like this carpenters manual helps us to think about the more intangible aspects, right? Creating a, a place that has good luck or is auspicious. When it comes to this site in nada, Japan, we're actually dealing with an earlier building site and the one on the left. But many of the sort of basic principles are, are there in terms of this sort of symmetry and the outer wall and the same basic kinds of buildings. So if we look at the layout, again, we're talking about a symmetrical axis up, up the center, but a much more limited number of buildings here. As you enter through the Main Gate and outer wall of this complex at WHO DO G, the Temple of flourishing law or religious site, a Buddhist site. In Japan. There is a pagoda on the left and the Golden Hall on the right. And we'll get into what each of those sort of to symbolically or functionally for Buddhism. In a minute, in the far back you have the lecture hall where monks would gather to discuss Buddhist ideals or principles. Then there are these guardian figures underneath is gate hall along the outer wall as well. So this is the very simple layout. Again a central axis, but differing buildings to the left and the right, rather than all the important buildings along that central axis. There's no sort of imperial walkway here, so to speak. This building site was actually first built for Prince show Tokyo, a guy who was made a set of repeated visits to our class, right beginning with the Chaka triad, that sculpture that we talked about with early Buddhism in Japan. And also we talked about Prince show tofu in the Common Core period that little idol of, of the prints as well. And one more time that is escaping me at the moment. Anyhow printout. Ok. You've heard of them. The first sight was a residence for him in narrow, which is the center of Buddhism and the center of imperial power for a little while. In Japan, as we've talked about, a fire raises the whole temple complex in 670, but it's rebuilt shortly after with this expanded lecture hall in the back. And we know from comparison to other early models, this is among the earliest buildings that exist in East Asia. That the stylistically and architecturally, this building complex came most directly from Korean models. And those in turn came from early Chinese models following the transmission of Buddhism. So long with the transmission, a Buddhist ideas and boost artworks comes architecture as well from the mainland through the peninsula, Korea, and to Japan. And so we can begin to think about the interconnectivity that these various kinds of traveling artisans and, and figures bring with them in terms not only of ideas but of physical spaces, right? Of creating temple spaces that promoted Buddhism, just like they promoted Buddhism on the mainland. But now in Japan. So looking from the back corner here, you have the main hall, the shorter and wider of the two buildings, or the Golden Hall as it's called. And this is the site where almost all of the major sculptures for this temple are located. It's where the active sort of public worship is happening. And there are a variety of statues and altars in the center platform of this hall. And they're all facing south, facing the front again, this is still on itself to north axis. They're all facing this way. And there from a variety of different early periods. But you can circum, navigate the whole space just like you could walk in a circle around the spaces that don't home or at soccer on these other early Buddhist sites. And you'll notice that the very central image, very central sculpture is the shock. A triad within the Golden Hall. From the outside is looks like a three storied building, because you have three sets of eaves. But the second set of eaves is stacked in underneath the first purely as a kind of ornamental addition and helps to give height and add importance to the buildings so that when you move into the space, the height of the kind of entry way and the height of his eaves opens up into a much larger space that feels expanded. Now, love of these glittering gold covered bronze sculptures of the various forms of these Guardian, these Bodhisattva's and of the Buddha, the historical Buddha himself again, as we know with this sculpture, mimicking the body of the person that's dedicated to write prints show tofu. To the left side you have a pagoda and we've already seen one pagoda from the farm and temple, right? And we talked about the crypt buried under it. And pagodas often had some sort of reliquary status. So buried under them. We're often supposedly various relics which gave them a kind of sacred nature common to many pagodas, as well as a central column that runs right up the middle and out the top. And may not be one continuous piece of wood, but it's made to look like a continuous piece of wood, often called the heart pillar. And inside at the very base, you usually have a small sculptural program, usually of the Buddha passing away and then moving on to the state of nirvana of enlightenment. And around the Buddha you'll often yet Allah has various disciples crying and being upset about the fact that the Buddha is passing on what Buddha is often shown sort of peaceful face as he moves into the next heavenly realm. Beyond attachment. The architecture of the pagoda has an iconographic meaning to it. Often there are five stories to the pagoda which are the Five cardinal directions, north, south, east, and west, plus a fifth direction, which is upward toward the heaven, which is how the building works functionally as well. Often, the number of these little sections doesn't correlate to the number of actual levels in the interior of the building, but are added on to give the sense of heights, an expansion or contraction as the tower goes up and toward the heavens as well. Just like church steeples drive your eye up toward the heavens as well. The top, the continuation of that central pole usually has nine parasol as that represent the nine heaven spheres. A flaming Pearl at the top. An image of sort of wisdom purified by the flames of belief and of Buddhism. And so these two buildings on the left serve these Buddhist functions. The buildings to the right and the left of that center axis, serve these functions of prayer and of symbolism to very fundamental Buddhist ideals. I didn't. Lecture hall in the back is where latent gathering, small gatherings of monks would have discussions about the dark, about the ideas of Buddhism. So if we're looking at these two sites, right? One is a religious site. It first starts off as a private temple in residence for print show tofu, but then it becomes a monastic Temple and the architecture is four. It is specifically designed for those purposes, a lecture hall, a pagoda with all of its Buddhist symbolism. And the warship space as, as well. And the, the Building here, as we've discussed, is a governmental building on the one hand and the front, and then a private residence as well. In the back. They both share this north-south axis, headed from south to north. There in this hierarchically ordered space right? Of buildings growing taller toward the middle and then lower at the edges, giving importance to certain kinds of, of buildings. They both are constructed along these fundamental ideas of geomancy, right? A picking the right site and making sure everything is auspicious about that site. And they also share the same basic architectural elements, right? The buildings are fundamentally very similar. And the basic features of East Asian architecture, which again is transmitted from China to Korea, to Japan. And there's a sort of shared base of, of knowledge. There are that this platform, this sort of pounded earth platform is at the foundation. There's usually no basement and no digging into the earth because the earth has to be sealed off to protect it from, to protect the building from any IN auspicious demons that might come out of the earth. So there's no digging down into the earth. Usually there's a gabled roof that is a kind of peaked roof covered with ceramic tiles. But the rest of the architecture is usually made out of wood. The beams support the roof, which is the heaviest element, right? So all the beams are arranged in order to support and elevate this roof, which is covered with this heavy ceramic tiles. And the beams also are not dug down into the earth and said they rest on shallow stone plants. And our waded into place by the roof itself. And this allows a little bit of mobility for what is generally an earthquake prone zone. And if the, if the pillars were set down into the Earth, as the Earth shook, the whole roof would come off as well. This gives a little bit of sway and flexibility. And the beams, again are bearing the weight of this heavy roof. But that weight and the height of that roof is distributed through a particular mechanism called the bracketing system. Instead of beams and cupping elements made out of wood with no nails. There's no metal holding these into place. That bracket and elevate the roof out and above where it would normally lie. And the discovery of early and the establishment of early architecture and architecture history in China is actually the results of 20th century scholarship. A man named Liang Cheng. Oh, it was among the first sort of leave China in the early national period, in the early 20th century to get a PhD elsewhere. Got a PhD in architecture at University of Pennsylvania. And he was a son of a major government official named Liang Qichao. And he's considered the father of modern Chinese architectural history because he established the first sort of timeline of architectural development in China and across East Asia. East Asia by going out and searching through old temples to create a stylistic genealogy of these buildings. And before this point, Architecture wasn't considered an art form or high art form. And again, you've probably seen hints of architecture in some of our other lectures, right? The wood family temple has these pillars on those little shallow stone supports with the bracketing system that holds the roof up front. That we talked about, the imitation of timber architecture in places like Dunhuang. And you get more fanciful versions of palaces, multi-storied palaces and other cave temples sites and Dunhuang. But the earliest actual existing temples to be discovered by people like Liang Cheng. And when he did his survey, it wasn't just a China. He actually looked at Japanese and Korean examples and compared them. And the construction techniques were quite similar among a lot of these early temples, like the temple of flourishing law, the layouts, and the various bracketing methods, these little stylistic and technical details help to form links between places like the non-Chinese Tempo. One of the earliest existing temples in China in Jiangxi Province, which dates to the Tang Dynasty. And this set of buildings here in in Japan. And again from that he created this sort of genealogy of building an architecture in China from the earliest periods of the tongue, where the earliest examples existed all the way up into the forbidden city during the Qing dynasty. And he couldn't have done this without these comparative examples across East Asia, between Japan and Korea and China. Because architecture had moved and the technology had moved via Buddhism and via the exchange of these geographic spaces early on. And also he couldn't have done it without the sort of very close stylistic analysis of things like the bracketing system. Remember this system that elevates the roof, pulls it up and beyond the pillared to create more space in the interior and more light in the interior. This was one of the key elements that he used to talk about, which buildings were more closely related and more dated at the same time than, than others. And again, they have functional purpose, right? They support the roof. They distribute all of the weight of that roof across the beam. But they also, from the Song dynasty onward, from about the 12th century onward, are used stylistically. You get sort of ornate extra ornamentation and extra kinds of bracketing that is not necessarily functional. So architecture become stylized in order to show greater importance. And it's through that focus on that detail that Liang Cheng managed to create his genealogy. And again, it's worth noting that there are no set metal or pins or nails holding this together. It's all a bracketing system in which you have a little bit of give in case things should start to wobble or move. And that supports this roof on these pillars that again are not dug into the ground that rest on this flat prepared ground plane. So that is the general discussion I've got a couple of minutes over. I apologize for that. But again, leave any questions in the discussion board and I'll have your papers done by Monday.

## [14. Tea](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/14-tea?module_item_id=2446631)
 Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and get started with class now, as I've recently announced in on Canvas, your prompts for your SAT and last essay happened posted. This is going to work. Well, it's exactly like the first essay did. Wherein you look at an image, but artwork we have not seen in class before. You describe it, you make a comparison to something that we have seen in class. Name that thing, date that thing, and pick a hypothesis about the unknown art object. Again, don't feel like I should have to reiterate this for writing assignments in general. But based off the first writing assignments, some of you might need a gentle reminder to look closely at the instructions as they're given. And then to think just more generally about what writing is you're trying to convince me of something, your hypothesis, based on your argument and your evidence. So randomly picking things that somehow manage to fulfill each individual bullet point won't actually result in a good essay because the acid hasn't come together toward the hypothesis in a way that is viable, in a way that makes sense. Art history is still something that is built off of evidence and argumentation. It's not just what you see and how you feel. Secondly, as I've discussed with your essays on your open note exam, and with the first essay, don't go looking to other sources. You have everything you need and what you see. And what we've discussed in class, when you go outside sources to just look up some sort of an answer, most of the time you're going to get it wrong. Haven't built quite. This goes out to contextualize things properly. And it's not going to make a lot of sense on top of that. You're not really exercising your own faculties of reasoning and writing, which is not the point of the essay. So with those little warnings out there, are there any questions about the essay and about the peer review which will be assigned after you turn in the.'s. All right. I'm not seeing any questions pop up, so I suppose things are relatively clear. Here's one. The essay is due in two weeks and not this Thursday, but the Thursday following. And then the peer reviews do the following Tuesday. So you have the weekend. Do your peer review. The essay's due the day of class. You don't have an extra week on the assignment like you do with quizzes. So it's due when it's due. Which is important to note. There's a little bit much time given. I've given the due date as five o'clock, but that doesn't close until midnight. I think that's only has a kind of safeguard, so it's due the end of the day on Thursday. Hope that was clear through. Good, great. And again, this is your last essay per little bit of, a little bit up until it doesn't have to be an extremely long essay, it just has to fulfill the various requirements. And do so in a piece of writing. Spend a little bit of time, but if you would, please, it makes it much easier to grade. Ok, let's get on with today's class. Again, just to reiterate, when we started off this early modern module, one of the things we've been talking about, this has certain kinds of materials or practices move across the spaces of East Asia and globally, more globally. We talked about architecture, we've talked about porcelain. And today we're going to talk about tea, which itself is a difficult thing to consider as an art object, right? But the thing that support the appreciation of T, r do qualify under that are sort of broad definition of objects that are belonging in art history that have occurred. A kind of artistic or thetic vocabulary and understanding around them. Including this jar, this vessel which has a name chi0 Giza, and this painting of two gentlemen join T with a group of poems. Above it. And you had excerpts from both a T diary that relates to the pot and excerpts from the Poems on when Yangming's painting. And we'll talk about each of those in turn. But we'll start with Japan will start with q0 goose, the pot that has a name. And we'll start with a kind of a question. One of the things that is pristine and lots of difficult about this classes that I give you mostly primary documents. And sometimes those documents are strange to us, for instance, a T. So in your Chat window, I want you to think about this first document that, that I've given you excerpts from, from 1587. A t diary written by a photon. So what is a t diary? What's its purpose? Do things based on its content. What things seem to be important in the text, and why do you think it was kept? And here's an image of the actual diary, but I'll post the transcription for you, translation for you so that you have to think about as you respond to this first general discussion question. Ooh. Oh, oh. True? This is a really good start guys. This is again, a kind of a tough thing to jump into because this is a format or kind of record keeping kind of historical document that may seem a little straight dry, but just by getting through the translation, we can begin just by sort of naming what we're seeing and thinking about the format. We can begin to kind of crack open the question of what a t diarrhea is and why you would keep such a thing. So as many of you said as diarrhea, Christina Indiana sort of started us off. This is just a simple description of vessels, the objects, right? And decor. That is the sort of things around the vessels that are serving the T. In that sense, you're getting a kind of a setting, right? It's like the description in a play of a scene, right? The scene has these things in an arranged this way. And these are the things, right? But as bad and air added, right? The people are important too, right? So the host and the guests are described as well. In that sense, Ben ventured to sort of describe the purposes of a T diaries. Keeping track of the sort of social engagements. And of course, the thing that we're seeing at that engagement. And the things are important just as, let's see Lydia Ko or describing some, some, some other folks that you get very specific things, name, there's a piece of calligraphy, right, that's listed at the beginning. And then the calligraphy is described in much more detail. Lower down the list for the sort of itemized list of the important things that were used and seen it at the T event fret. So you get P, o, a general description of the scene, things in it. And then you get very specific descriptions of, of objects that were probably the most importance, right? This sort of detailed level inscriptions. And as C, i, C just has talked about this and so it's Tyler. The fact that if the purpose here is to sit together and drink tea, you would think that much of the description would revolve around how the teat tasted, right? That's what we tend to think about when we go and buy various things at Starbucks or wherever we're going to get our caffeinated. We want to know what it tastes like. We want the taste to be a certain way, but that's not the case. As you've rightly point out. It's more about the social atmosphere. It's a cultural event as many of you pointed out, gathering and having tea. So it's about a social network and kind of event and the specific objects pulled out for that event. And what are those specific objects, right? So the three things that are item as below are interesting for a couple of reasons. For one. The first item is a Korean table. Just to be explicit about where the T diaries being kept, its being written in, in Japan. And so the specific designation of assumptions, Korean object marks it as separate, as different, as foreign, as exotic, right? And it specifically used for when the T is thin. And we'll go into the tea ceremony in a minute because there are several stages to steeping and drinking the tea. So when the t is thin, you want a Korean bowl because there's a kind of correspondence to the physical material, sort of aspects of the bowl and how the thin tea is appreciated best in Korean bowl than you have the calligraphy scroll. And again, it's sort of an itemized and very stripped down description calligraphy scroll, as you know above, from the general description, it's biased and monk. So we might think back to our Stevia Zen. And there's a strong connection between Xen and T appreciation. And then the itemized description talks about just how many characters there were and how big it was. And there are two graphs are words in the opening two lines, and then there's an indentation. It's, it's sort of a blow by blow description of. Finds a number of characters and then the borders around the calligraphy, which has a connection to religion, right? Zen. And then you get one of the objects we're focusing on CI goose. And you get a really detailed visual analysis almost of the object right? Beginning with the material, its course and it's rather the lower part swells and on the bottom there little blisters. And therefore ciphers or four words. The graph show is above one ciphers, the glazes for the thick and there were all these downward flow to the clays. And below that there appears to be a divide in the glaze was glazed maybe at two different moments are dipped twice. There are three potting lines from the neck between the two of the logs and above, there are small lines in in three areas. In one area, the place between the lugs. They cannot be seen. So the lines only go partway around the neck where the little handles are. And then it goes to describe the outfit that the, that the object is wearing as well. And that's described above, right? So you go to this part of bulk during the intermission, the calligraphy role was rolled up. And she goes that was placed in the alcove instead. And we'll see in a picture later that there's a sort of setting to the appreciation of the tea ceremony, including a little recessed alcove in whoosh, objects for appreciation while you're drinking are viewed. And in this case, a calligraphy scroll is first that's rolled up, put away, and then she GSA is placed out. And she goes to has a mouth cover that's red coloured with small goal advocated. And an old chord that's in light blue color with a nodding style that is described as the old style. And that is repeated again. Hello in this description. So again, this is a strange duck in a way, but it's about people in a room together appreciating the same things and therefore enjoying one another's accompany and appreciation in that process. And is less about the actual drinking of tea than the things that are brought out and shown and appreciated. So it's about taste, right? Not physical tests, but more of a kind of abstract sense of taste in art, some taste and culture. So here are some examples of the various objects that might go into a tea ceremony, like the one you've just read about rant. Here is a horizontal wall hanging scroll of a Zen Buddhist text. And again, just as we read in the description of the te dire, you get the number of lines or number of graphs. The fact that there may or may not be seals will kind of brocade borders around it. There are sometimes unadorned or on decorated, really simple wood objects, right? That contrast with the glazed objects like this Chinese tea bowl from the 13th century, which we know is used in tea ceremonies. And as well as this Japanese produced thing from a later period, the 18th century or so. That is a lacquered object. So you're getting a variety of different textured materials from different origins and from different points in the past curated for this gathering. And in that sense, you might think about it like a, not only a kind of a play right there. Different actors in the play, in a different setting or backdrop to the enjoyment of t. But there's a cure Turiel aspect to it as, as well. Like it's a little museum setting, right? Certain things come from the deep past. Certain things are new to contrast. It's Instagram posts before, before such things existed in a way. Let's move on to key goose and think about how exactly this thing is, is described. Why do you think it's described like this? What is the benefit of describing something with this degree of detail? Maybe not, maybe not a great question, but let's say we believe we got one answer. Great. Ryan. Thanks, Brad, and makes it easy to visualize the object and your time trying to sort of show your appreciation through really delicate, precise description. So rind are great comments. It shows a kind of value as band is talking about or talking about. Also, it makes it really specific. This is an object with a specific identity it and has quirks to it, right? So if you're looking at the object itself here, you can see those three potting lines and only go partway around the neck, right? If you're looking at another object, those product might go all the way around the neck perhaps. Or there might be a different kind of a drip or folding line. As the glaze had been dipped over this vessel only partially, not all the way down to the foot. And so that particular kind of downward flow or where the, where the glaze appears to divide. My different talk about these sort of flows is worth glaze has been applied in consistently and you get this sort of thick, unctuous flow or extra glaze and pigment condensed in these sections here. And then you get the description of the characters on the bottom. It's like describing a friend to someone who's never seen it before. Their nose like this, their eyes are like this. They wear their hair this way. They've got this kind of a necklace on or they've got, you know, this face tattoo, whatever. These sort of specific to describing. Almost WHO chiggers is. And the fact that it's named gives a sense of this object is not just a simple vessel for storing tea and the tea ceremony, which is how it's being used functionally in the tea ceremony. But that moment in the tea ceremony where you go through a thick kind of description of the object to not only identify it, but also to show appreciation, right? Just like you do when you're doing a visual analysis, there's a kind of respect that's been folded into that thick description. I'm an object. It's almost as if the object is a kind of celebrity, right? Here's another description from a different T diary of the year before. And the T diarrhea of Matsui. He's a OCI. And you can see that there are some similarities, but slight differences as well, right? So the way in which each person describes the vessel has to do in part with how their resp in to what it is they're seeing. But this is the same vessel I began as she goes to a large jar is displayed from the beginning. So you're getting a sequence of events even in these T diaries, right? Whereas before in the first t diary, she goose has brought out halfway through the tea ceremony. Here she goes, says displayed from the very beginning. They talk about on the underside of LID. And they're supposed to be. The inscription by this famous te dire is called no army. The light-blue net and the gold brocade. And the chord that's now light brown colored. The to both. The chord that is and the cover are old. And there's a historical background, right? It's reported that insects who had both the cover and the procreating or the courting made and the mouth cover, he says it, is especially remarkable. It's actually a Tang dynasty piece of embroidered textile or silk. And so this object is being given quite a fancy and antique outfit, right? Its mouth cover and its various cords. This writer decides to estimate the size of the job based on how much it can hold, right? 5-6 gin or your kin of TPP. He talks about the lines at the mouth as well. And the fact that the waste, there are none of these distant mountain lines, which is one of the ways in which P jars and their glazing can be appreciated. And there's just a one colored glaze over the whole object, except that it's got a texture to it, which he calls a quail green texture. And that's the spotting that you're seeing on the vessel itself. It goes on to describe the fact that there are no scorch marks on it. And if there's an overlap in the glaze and the clay is this beautiful red. That is remarkable. And then he finishes off this by just saying this is a May boots. So what does that category of object that gets all of this kind of description that war installed, this kind of attention and a t diary and in the city itself. So I'm able to literally it can be translated to a kind of a subgrade an object or a famous thing, right? And maybe would submit B might be judged based on shape as we just read, right? It's, it's kind of wastes like this and neck like this. Its size right here. This thing is impressive because it can hold about 5-6 gin, which is a measure unit of T. And the general impression it gives on the viewer, the last person we read talked about it as being remarkable, right? And for the specific object which is used in the tea ceremony to whole the, the tea leaves, right? There are criteria that become more fit than others. Single drips that go down the surface of the glass and you can see some of those in profile here. A big fat glazed drips, a horizontal line that goes only halfway around the vector, such as the ones neck, right? The glaze flow is overlapping in these ways. These are two distinct mountain ridges, right? Given these metaphors, names. And although not on this fast though not described on vessels, finger marks at the bottom from the potter. And what's fascinating in part about this is the fact that depending on your taste in ceramics, all of these things can also be described as poor rupee crafted pottery. Some of the pottery that we've looked at before, right? The solid Dalit and the porcelain ramp is a much finer material. There's no variation at the surface. It's evenly glazed all around. And this vibrant green color, which is prized for all of these other metaphorical values, right? It's like the moon caught set at nighttime spring, right? It's Moss, It's a mosque covered mirror. Here. All of the inconsistency is, are being paid attention to the things that would have made this a poorly potted or created vessel. Slip ups, the accidents that make it an imperfect surface, or the things that get now a celebrated object. It's the things by which it's recognized its scars repaid its particular oddities that become attractive. Now one nostril is bigger than the other. You know, the eyebrows are too long or whatever it is. If you're describing a kind of person who's having particular characteristics. And another word for this particular class of objects that especially are used in the tea ceremony or larger Japanese culture that come from China is kinda mono and literally translates to an object that comes from the Tang Dynasty or from the Golden Age of cosmopolitan China. And if you look closely at the description of this T vessel, right? As its as it exists online. You'll notice that this is an object that is used in tea ceremonies in Japan from the 16th century or so onward. But which has its origins about 300 years earlier and in a different place altogether. This is a storage container that was probably made China sometime around the third century. And based on comparison to other early ceramics found and things like this, shipwreck, a 13th century shipwreck off the coast of Guangdong province, southern China. This was probably a up of very basic shipping where ME, transportation within the very trading routes of China, Japan, and South Asia in the 13th century. And you can see in this shipwreck that there are a variety of vessels that are basically the same shape with the same sort of logs official to these logs help that help to kind of pick up the vase, right? You can run a string through them. And these things would have stored oil, your basic trading goods, maybe sesame oil, maybe soy sauce, maybe a certain kind of vinegar that would've been traded more locally within the South Asian trading routes. So how does an object like this, which is originally made for something very simple. It's, it's the equivalent of Tupperware in the 13th century in China. Just to get the materials from one place to the next, it all of a sudden becomes famous. It becomes named, becomes valued for all of the things that would've made it. Or, or at least in Song Dynasty, China, would have distinguished as something cheap and easily made. All of these mistakes in the imperfections in the surface, right? The modeling that you get from a rough surface that has a lot of impurities in it. The inconsistent glaze that gives you the so-called quail pattern, right? That's created because the material mixed in with the glaze to give it color, is mixed in somewhat inconsistently and separates over the rough surface of the object itself. Things like the thumb prints would've been signs in a much higher quality piece of porcelain of a defect would've been thrown out. Remember in the video where that lady smack does the veil is because it has a slight perfection in it. This thing is made and perfectly it's made quickly and it's made cheaply, but it gives it character. And those little aspects of character are described in loving detail later on in the 16th century in Japan. And these tea ceremony diaries, even the basic sort of glazing, the reason why this is glazed one once here you can see it being dipped in the glaze here there's an edge or a halo at the edge here. And then being dipped again in the glaze from the bottom down in through the top. Without the glaze coming the very basis because it's easier to fire that way. The glaze is all the way down to the bottom and at the bottom of the glaze, you risk sometimes having the glaze adhere to or fuse with the various Sanger's or other things in kill him that help to separate it from the other objects. And so a cheap and easy piece of pottery like this earthenware pottery with a simple cheap glaze, is not fully glaze on the bottom because that doesn't matter to the people making this as a basic storage vessel in the 13th century. And so what's fascinating about it is that it becomes appropriated and repurposed. An old thing that was cheap and relatively meaningless now becomes a kind of superstar within the tea ceremony. Pan. Because if its associations with China, you'll notice that there's a kind of it's association here with cholera mono at large. This object was made in the 13th century. So during the Song Dynasty in China. And yet the whole class of objects that come from ancient China are all called as Tang Dynasty objects are really often when they actually were, were made because that was this point of high contact and height culture between Japan and China. The time of Buddhisms flourishing and the time of the connectivity between especially Japan and China through the Buddhist church. And these things become celebrated not only in the tea ceremony for the eye, they, they get outfits made for them, a kind of formal attire. So she Goose as it exists, now, write this 13th century object that was made cheaply gets radiated in the 16th century in Japan. It now is. It has these extra vessels that are created to, to support and protect it, right? It has four outer containers that it's put into to give its stability. It has these special chords that are described in the tea ceremony diaries. This textile top, which itself is an antique from the Tang Dynasty. And then these core, which are just supposed to functionally steal the T off from the rest from, from the air, right? The rest of the world are nodded in these special designer ways as, as well. And various cauda mono, these special objects from Tang Dynasty, supposedly China, or may boots who celebrated objects used in tea ceremony, had these kind of outfits built for them. That's how precious they became. Even if, like with chiggers, they've come from very humble origins. And that brings us to this sort of question of the sort of things we name rent. When this was made in the 13th century in China, nobody thought to give it a name. It was just another jar that you stuff things into so that they can be transported and sold somewhere else. But when it became celebrated in the tea ceremony. It was given this poetic name that came from walkout court poetry. Remember we talked about aristocratic poetry in the hay on Period in Japan and how people spoke to each other through the metaphors of poetry, divulging their emote to one another through metaphors. And she GSA, which means a 1000 grasses, is a citation from a famous one of these aristocratic Poems. And the equivalent that I could maybe make for you today is, is if you if you went to Kroger and got yourself, I don't know. What do you what would you get it? How about a large glass container? Dill pickles. Why not? It's lunchtime ish. And that and after you eat a o pickles, you save that del pickled are until 20 years later you decided that it was a special thing attached and you touch all these special memories to it, you used it for, I don't know, preparing hot cocoa for your grandmother or doing whatever you did with this new jar now on the dress step and you gave it a name, right? Name. You give a dill pickle jar, but Greensleeves will haunt Greensleeves ramp. So why do you why do you name a thing? You name a thing because you make it specially make it distinct from other things and because memories are attached to it, you, especially with drink the objects, right? There's a sort of ritual attached to it even now, right? Whether it's coffee or tea, most will have a kind of moment and ritual to an I-beam, these sort of basic things in their, in their lives. But think back to the history of objects like this vessel, right? Which is a, a vessel meant for pouring things within Shang dynasty. Actual, the tea ceremony itself is a highly ritualized, structured and inter between people and objects in which the objects are paid close attention to and the people are paid close attention to. And we give names to the sorts of objects that we treasure, right, that have memories attached to them. So for instance, there, they're just mugs that I have in my cupboard. But they're mugs that I have in my cupboard because they had special attachments. I've formed memories around is otherwise very normal things, right? This mug came from my grandmother, my grandfather's cupboard after he died. And I remember actually drinking tea with him and my grandmother before. With these very, very cheap remarks that you can find almost anywhere with the sort of Robin's Egg Blue colour on the inside. They were the equivalent of, or this sort of, I'm trying to say. There are very common in the fifties, there were suburban staple, basically these tailor-made porcelain mugs or thick porcelain. My sister got into pottery and little and in high school and made for me when I was in college. There's brown glaze on the middle and assertive TO glaze on the outside. These two little rings that mostly go all the way on the vessel. And this is the most like chiggers. It's a little unfinished, a little raw. It's actually terrible to drink tea out of for anything a hot out of, because the clay that's been chosen transmits the heat to the outside very quickly. So I might call this my piping hot brown thing. Don't tell my sister. I usually don't use that hot things at all even though that's why she gave it to me. And then there's this giant mark here which has the advantage of being able to hold a lot of coffee. And I call it big fidelity because I think it's, it's just, I don't like the design on it, but it was given to me by my husband. And so it's something that I treasure as a kind of terrible gift that someone I like got for me. Um, and so you can name these things out of affection and out of a kind of acknowledgment of the meaning of the people that attach to them, right? Maybe ritual objects in a way. So that is the long way of connecting or object. She goes to these tea ceremony diaries and to thinking about how something very simple and basic becomes something important and how this TDR becomes a celebrated Kiara mono or may boots soon through these processes of naming and designing events that circulate around specific objects. So how exactly was this used? We're going to play a little meeting, a little video here to show what it is that the tea ceremony last works. There's there's a couple of things in this video I object to in terms of the content that's placed in the subtitle is. But what I want you to do is watch what, how a tea ceremony takes place. If I can figure out how to switch share content, ever go, go. Alright, so drop the phi m because its coordinate music. And hopefully you're watching this tea ceremony. So notice how the person perform. The ceremony is making me do movement. Very deliberate, right? This is done because there is a certain kind of ritualized fact, not ritual and this ends up being religious. But that there are certain gestures, movements that are, uh, that, uh, size_t. And that make the enjoyment, the eventual enjoyment of the beverage itself more enjoyable because you go through this elaborate process of preparing at elaborate down to how the napkin is folded, how it is handled, how each vessel is cleaned for the person enjoying the the T. And then again, the movements themselves being deliberate, slow and precise. You don't just ball up your napkin and put it beside you. It has to be folded certain way. Again, some of the subtitle is a little bit overboard. Movement has mean in a kind of direct symbolic way. But every gesture is meaning fall and it's post. And again, there are variations to the tea ceremony. It's not like the exact district have to be the same for all 500 years of its activity. This part is o to t ceremonies, where they do last in a half a day or more. Little snacks or sometimes brought out and there's a whole sort of procedure to the day. It's not just about drinking the tea, right? It's about enjoying the objects, maybe talking in a kind of surreal way about the objects. Different stages of the T are appreciated as well. So there's a kind of initial pore which is usually tossed down the drain for Chinese tea ceremony is not Japanese. There you might smell are handled with bullet points and all of these different aspects draw out the tea ceremony. And so within this you'll see again each of the objects, it has a function, a role than it performs in terms of holding something, whether it's hot water, whether it's the T, it's self, whether it's the team mixture, the hot water that then gets port into an individual cup. The whisk, the onwards, the tea kettle for S, the label for the hot water on the burner. But there's a variety of textures and materials here in order to provide that sense of a kind of curated experience. And it's like watching a very slow and deliberate that's almost right at Washington. Somebody prepare the tea for you and you're supposed to enjoy each and every one of these that are gestures, aspects, and objects. I think that's probably enough. T7 or to give you an idea of again, how slow and deliberate the gestures are and how the appreciation of the objects is sort of part and parcel of appreciating the whole ceremony itself. Get back to o Powerpoint. Talk my way through this tea preparation style, right? There's deliberate group of gestures. They can last several hours, all in order to drink the beverage, which we think of him as a kind of convenience that we combine any grocery store, any in a coffee shop. And the curation of the various people and objects there is in a way of larger project of just slowing down time and slowing attention and focusing it on certain kinds of valued objects. These Karen mono or may boots too. And this is described broadly as channel you to write the art of T or T preparation in Japan. And it arrives in and via China to begin with and is strongly associated with Zen, right? And think about some of the things we learned about Zen Buddhism, right? The deliberate kind of laborious repetition of the same kind of a task that can lead eventually to modes of enlightenment. And the appeal of this kind of non verbal action focused form of Buddhism is being focused again on the kind of ritual of preparing tea. It was popular within Zen monasteries to conduct tea ceremonies. People pay to go have a tea ceremony conducted, a Zen temple or monastery. But then the practice spread out into the private worlds as well. Now in Japan, what is used is ground up t cakes or much of which you probably know from Starbucks, right? This sort of ground up bright green powder that's added to things. And again, much our mortar is just ground up tea leaves. But there's another way of appreciating and enjoying T altogether, which is drying out the leaves sort of a curl up into these little balls when they dry out. And then steeping believes against that leaves, then expand when you add new hot water. So that's steeping the tea leaves itself versus the ground t0, which gives you this kind of creamy, much broth or foamy broth of t. But again, what we want to emphasize both in Japan where we've just looked at it and you know, where we are about to look at the driver going up T. This is about slowing things down and appreciating them with a select group of guests. Curated group of objects. It's about refining your taste in a kind of public and public and a kind of private pay. It helps to reinforce your sense of elites taste with other people that you're sharing the experience with. It's like going to a museum with a, with a friend. So the Chinese mode of preparation is slightly different. And that moment of differentiation for preparing t happens in the Song Dynasty up until the Song Dynasty in China and then in Japan. Generally it was ground up or Matcha tea that was used for drinking tea. And then of course, the tools to hold the tea leaves, to grind them up, to whisk them together to create the broth all fit that kind of ground tea process. The tools ever ceremony have to actually function within the tea ceremony. So just returning for a moment to our favorite site here, the farmer temple. In that crept under the Rather query. There's a whole set of T implements in gold and silver. And you can see from the implements that they are grinding, they're there for grinding teeth. And our little team vignette here in the foreground of Emperor waves Ong's ceremony shows some of those same kinds of objects. But after the Song Dynasty in China, there was a switch. One of the emperors decided that he wanted to teach preparedness slightly different way. He didn't want them ground up, but he wanted the whole tea leave steeped itself. And this didn't take hold as much in Japan where that ground t0 stayed popular. So I'm preparation and the, and the enjoyment of Chinese tea. Again, you don't have to hear me kind of walk my way through the trip to the video here, to the video store. As you'll notice, is this slightly at different? Alright, here we are. Here we are. Just as in the Japanese tea ceremony, right? You have your water in a kettle on some sort of a braise year to boil. You have a little T container and earned a little sheet that you can pour the tea leaves into, but the tea leaves are dried in these little pellets, right? That they drive back in on them, on themselves. Here. This person has decided to elaborate that at every stage and enjoying tea, you might stop and smell, as suggested, at the tea leaves before they get steeped in the hot water. You might use as this person is writing and saying here, hot water in order to rinse out the vessel itself and warm it up. And then you'd have a whole container which is just for holding your waste water. Well. And again, this one or no, this is this is for for pointing to T eventually, but it's person arming up that piece of porcelain. But there's still a container for, for wastewater. Here's another bamboo school prep that is being used to shovel the tea into the teapot. You add the hot water to these already warmed things. And the main difference here is that the leave are steeped at different moments up to five or six different times, you can add more hot water to these tea leaves. A lot of people take first rinse, they don't like the taste of it. And it's used to clarify and to warm up the tea leaves itself and then you throw that water out entirely. Here she is. The actual COP. Somebody drinks from the steepening of the t. Because when you actually might let it sit for a moment and let the tea leave flavor move from a t to the water. And then you'd have your first stage of, of drinking these steeped tea leaves that was poured out and each of these cups. You might then use the same tea leaves for a third, fourth pouring our steeping up the leaves. And so again, the objects themselves. Then to this mode of preparing tea, the tea cups become much smaller because you have many small servings of different stages of its steeping. And at each stage you're appreciating the variances in flavor. The first steeping might bring out certain aspects of the tea flavor that in the third one are very different and very strong and kind of robust at first and then become weaker and a bit delicate or floral on its second or third steeping. And so just as in the Japanese version, which is a little bit more codified, it's more ceremony, it's more of a ritual. Within feet is preparation of tea. There are these various moments for appreciation, for refining your taste, for thinking about what it is you're smelling and enjoying and tasting. Well, as of course, the objects involved. Right rear figure I'm making on a Thursday. And the first texts that we have that describe the sort of enjoyment of B is just as with the, just as with the T diary, focus less on the flavor of the tea then about the enjoyment and appreciation of all the things that go in you enjoying t. So for instance, the Classic of t, right? This text written supposedly in the middle of the Tang dynasty by Louis. Has a whole section just on boiling the water, right? This is the simplest stage, right? You just gotta get the water hot before you can have t. But if you're appreciating each thing, when the water is boiling, it has to look like fish eyes and give off just a small sound. And when at the edges it begins chatter like a bubbling spring. Looks like pearls that are measurable, measurably struck together. Any of you who've ever boiled water recently, writers, there are stages to the water actually coming up to a full boil and one of them is at the edge of your vessel that you're boiling the water and the bulb was kind of all gathered there before it goes into full full throttle. Which is when it leaps like Breakers, right? Like a way for breaker wave. Majestic and resounds a swelling wave that's when your water is at its peak. Notice again these natural metaphors involved. The LU discusses when you make that first Poor right there frothy patches. And remember this is ground t0 in the Tang dynasty. And those frothy patches should look like editing pools. That is when you watch a stream. And then at a certain part in the stream, usually near the edge there's a kind of pool and things gathering that pool. Twisting is Let's, or floating duckweed at the time of the world's creation. And what was the last time you looked into your coffee cup and had one of these out of body existential experiences are like, oh my god, I'm staring into the void of the world's creation. This is the way in which, again, appreciating and enjoying something as simple as t is elevated to an art form in, and things involved with it get elevated as well. Leaders Classic of t does talk a little bit more about flavor than R t that we just looked at. The idea that your first cup should have a haunting, flavored speed. Strange image should last a while. You sip it only barely. Otherwise, the flavor easily gets dissipated in your mouth. So again, these moments that are described here are about appreciating something that we take often for granted and paying close attention to it. A kind of meditational practice almost which is why it's often associated with Zen and Buddhist practice. Slits. And to our second object, the painting in which you have two gentlemen here and joined tea and conversation and a nice little woody environment in the hills, right? And a monochromatic or only painted in terms of gray and black. If you open it up and look closer, there's a little boy fanning the fire under the hot water heater. Whose preparing the tea. These guys. And in the foreground, you get this figure walking over the bridge and into the painting in a way sort of leading the viewer into the painting and joining his friends in this little secluded mountain hut to enjoy. T. So look at your inscriptions that are written on this painting. And tell me what it is that when Geng Ming, more or less at the same time as R t diary comes from how he's dating tea in China. One of the poems tell us what are the kind of images about what do they like? Yeah, tap into happened near one domain poems. And then put that into the chat window when you have the name of this painting. Might this be the art of tea? I've forgotten and it's on your Canvas page. I don't have it labeled here. You're right. But it's his painting named go to your Canvas page and double-check. It might just be the Art of T. Yeah. Thank you, Eric. Okay, great debate on that by giving me some, some quotes from the poem. So where do you see a kind of spiritual aspect? Suppose it would have helped if I put the palms up on the slide. Right? So many of you are talking about the end of the leaves are as precious as yellow, gold. And that poem is one of the one that gets ten poems, 12345678910. The poems that when Geng Ming has written on this painting. And what's interesting about the poems, I'll come back to that slide in a minute. Here's the first one. The T sprout is that they focus on all of the stages that get the tea into the bowl to begin with, including picking material, right? So the east wind is blowing across the russet T rosette being kind of brownish color than a single night, it grows an inch, right? So when you, when you're involved in agricultural production, often with certain crops, you know, there's a tight window in which you want to harvest it for certain kinds of flavor and affect. And so when the east wind is blowing across arrests at t0, that kind of an evening. All of a sudden you get these sprouts that grow a whole mention just one night. You have a floral miss that splits the heavy jagged leaves, right? So these leaves sprout and then split into other leaves. And missed is causing that to happen. And then clouds gently congeal there tend to fragrance. One of the things that's interesting here is that it's almost as if the atmosphere itself is acting like a giant vessel, right? Its condensing the flavors in the midst of the waters of the clouds around the tea leaves. And at this particular stage that the harvest that you can get an, a warning of these leaves that grow very fast and when it shows just less than a hand. And so these leaves are, as the second line from that down, tells us precious as yellow, gold. And they're offered almost as tribute or is very respectful gifts during spring festival. And so you're getting an attention here to the growing process at the TV and knowledge on the behalf of the poet and painter of o, when it is that tea leaves or Harvard and how they're harvested and the different flavors that come from harvesting. Different times when it comes to the brewing poem, right? You're getting all of these other kinds of elaborate just to the process of boiling it ramp. So just as with the description of the Japanese tea ceremony, you get an attention to the overall atmosphere in this poem. Write spring flowers or fault, put out a fragrance to our yard that is covered in these flowers. A gentle when calms the meditation room. And with the blowing of the wind, you're also getting a kind of echoing of the movement of the water in and around. The tea leaves tend to fire to boil fresh spring water, right? This isn't just normal pond water. This is water and it's got high up from the spring, so then it's pure. And the cold moon is floating round and shadowy in water, right? It's reflected in the water. Sleepless. It ever writing of the worthy faithful to the eternal emotions, wandering Immortals about the breeze here. Fs effortless, effortlessly entering the spirit realm. And that's where diary brings up this kind of aspect of otherworldly or spiritual aspects to t. And we have to kind of wonder here in his poem whether part of what's being appreciate it is the caffeinated, straight. Sleeplessness that comes with drink and perhaps too much tea. But in these references to eternal emotions, and Immortals kind of appearing out of the night and from the air around the T's production. For that give this sense that the T appreciation and enjoyment connects you to the larger world around you and into the kind of passed in a sense. So the set of poems are written on this painting in 1534, which is when this painting is dated. And at the very end, these last 123456 lines that when Geng Ming gives us, he actually tells us the events around the enjoyment of this, of this t. He writes at the T harvest that haven't pool in Tiger was at its height at this day in late April. But he himself was sick, he was ill. And so you stay with the house? He didn't want to. He was he was coronavirus confining or whatever. Saf sof by stirring. And he was unable to go with the other efficient on its, the other people who enjoy tea, connoisseurship of the tea out in the fields. And again, that connects to the fact that this one poem is all about going in and knowing how the cheese picked, even though many of us know how are coffee beans or tea leaves get picked. These guys were all about going to and studying those aspects you tea production. But he can't go with friends to go enjoy this. But his friends thought of them as friends who did go and they brought back a few varieties. This t that had been harvested. And so we had water drawn up from a spring, any brood them up and tasted them. And remembering the act of drinking, right? And this is something that we might think of in relationship to sort of synesthesia, right? The, the idea that you can be engaged, one sensory aspect can have a kind of another sensory experience or the fact that smells and tastes trigger memory in ways that simple writing does, does not. He remembers these other poems to ten eulogies on tea utensils by the Tang dynasty poets P and Lou. And so he follows them here, which is to say a poems are not the poems from the Tang dynasty. But he's imitating them, He's emulating them and celebrating room. And this next into our ideas about literati tape, right, that we've talked about is that even haven't experienced in the present. And it becomes more meaningful when you can attach it to poems or events from the past that are agreed upon as influential or interesting. Including in this instance, tenure is on the tea utensils by these poet named P and leader. He said, I'm not going to compare myself to their poetry. Recording the feelings of that moment of enjoying the tea that my friends brought to me when I was sick. And the fact that I had this connection, it's historical poems hammered, and so I just painted this picture alongside it to casually remember that event. And so what we're getting here again is V i d t is part of a kind of larger cultural milieu that is really paying attention the statically to the things that you do and the things that you use. Here. Among the literati of China, right? Who are making calligraphy, writing poems and painting like when Geng Ming is doing. The appreciation tends to everything about enjoying the team, not just the taste. Watching the water rise and bubble, going out and picking tea with friends or watching the T being harvested. And it's really about the company of the people you're enjoying. The t, Where it's like any past time that you can be a connoisseur of. Unless about a flavor itself. It's about connoisseurship comparing taste, and about creating a kind of social network around people who share that taste and can compare those aesthetic tastes. Not only among themselves, but in this case with poets from the deep past, straight from the dynasty. That puts P and I'm Lou. Now there's one slide I to, in order to get to the point, let's sort of put it out of whack. And that's just a little bit of background on Hou Wen Geng Ming was. And why are we thinking about him with this or that we talked about in the Song dynasties literati word. So when Geng Ming was born in relatively wealthy family. But when he tried to go take those imperial exams, that got you into government service. He failed ten times in a row. Pretty rough experience for somebody who was born in a family that expected this of him and who created for this. He eventually was given a very low-level position and a kind of a pity passed. There were certain kinds of government positions you could basically by, by this point in time. And he did a few years of service in this low-level position and then he retired. You might hear a kind of echoing of somebody like legal noon right? Goes into service but then retires. Or somebody like Wang Shi teacher who tries to kind of create this sense of himself as a, as a hermit for not being in service to a government. That he doesn't agree with that point. But for Wednesday May it's really about having the luxury and the leisure to not. Have to be an official. And also perhaps being slightly embarrassed that his low stature and rent. And he lives in Suzhou, which is in the south, and it's a very, very wealthy city. And the social network that existed there included lots of people were going to cut-off, categorize into this term, right, of literati or people who are very wealthy, highly educated, and who exchange these references to the past with one another. Something that has its roots really in the Song Dynasty model that we've talked about in the last module. And these weren't just government officials. They can include other educated folks too, including doctors, including merchants. And in some rare instances. Many of the matriarchs or women of the family were also educated, even if they couldn't go into government service. Some families took it as a pride to educate the women in the household as well. And in many of these families was actually the women who did the initial teaching of young sons, who would then go on to government service and help to sustain the family. So last time we talked about China, you're right, there's this transit. The Ming dynasty when the Mongolian rulers are kicked out by this new dynasty, which calls itself the Maine, which is now again Han dynasty. Han ethnicity, Chinese people ruling China. Do Joe was it very heavily tax during the Ming dynasty because it didn't immediately join in this rebellion that the first Ming Emperor had helped to lead. And so there was a little bit of retribution there. But by the early 15th century, initial tax has been alleviated. And because the Grand Canal, this main shipping pathway for the heartland of China, I've opened up Cdb and quite rich through trade. And you get this bustling metropolis of highly educated, highly wealthy people just looking for time, think do with their time. Ways to show that their intellect and their appreciation to one or another, including painting, calligraphy, poetry, and T, appreciation. So jurors asking, did they just find the tier two they have small crops to pick from. So they would go to the tea cultivation fields which existed outside of PDF Suzhou, outside of Hangzhou in most places in the South. And just go to the farms up of other of other people. It's possible, i don't know for certain, that they might have been landowners that ONE, some of these cultivated areas and have people as tendons farming them. But I don't know for certain and so I couldn't say that. So this is Hou Wen Geng Ming is and this is why living sort of as an early retired person among wealthy folks. He's spending a lot of his time writing poems, making calligraphy, making paintings for friends. Going out and enjoying picking tea, going out and enjoying just the brewing of t with each of these friends. And these are slides you've seen before. And again, these friends are enjoying his company to the extent that when he can't make it out there to go enjoy the T, they bring the tea to him as retract T. Where we're able to track is the appreciation of certain kinds of taste and culture. And I'm in a much larger sense. So it's not just about a single porcelain object gets about the way in which enjoying t, Next you to a network of other minded people in which you can enjoy not only the objects with the tea ceremony, but the whole process itself of team. And it's embedded history that goes back to these ancient poems that Brent Yangming as referencing in his own new poems where he revives these ID must act to a theme that runs through a couple of these early modern lectures, like with porcelain. We might think of the object on the right as being an artwork, right? And it involves the personalized invest, investment of a mind and intellect, right? Writing poems that reference ancient poems and make them that calligraphy very artful. And making a painting which is self making references to old paintings. We won't talk about, we think about the thing on the right as an artwork. But the thing on the left is something that is easy for us to understand as an artwork, right? It has a history of being a very simple, basic storage vessel. But it becomes elevated through taste and through the tea ceremony itself, and through the intentional associations that are attached to this otherwise nameless object. That does then given a name, it becomes important in its own right and becomes a kind of ugly duckling elevated two prints are princess status. And again, we think about a right more is kind of high traditional art. But the thing I left tells us just as much about what people saw in the world around them and how they thought about aesthetics, how they thought about the appreciation. If it's in people in their daily lives as, as well. And again, this sort of relates to, again, a point we made with porcelain that through looking B, enjoyment and circulation of things that are more Compton. Pyramid, basic material culture. We can understand how light travels, how visual motifs shift from one place to another, how taste changes with an object like cheap, so stubble ordinarily storage vessel becoming an object of height taste within the context of Pan, enjoying China from a distance and enjoying the tea ceremony. I'm kinda cultural understanding that follows right? The object Shi Guo says a car, a mono because it's associated with and China. Just as porcelain was associated in Europe who with Far East, as we got in the Montagnier painting. But when these things content, they have convenings as well, which we talked about with the appropriation importance on by a Korean period potters as well. So that brings us to the end of class today. And hopefully you've answered both of these questions and thinking about these two very different kinds of objects that tell us about taste and culture in Japan and China during this early modern period. Oh, thank you. Be sure to get on your writing assignments and I will talk to you on Thursday. Office hours at the end of the day to day if you can't talk about anything. Thank you, guys. Thank you. 




## [15. Europe and Japan](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/15-europe-and-japan?module_item_id=2446632)
 Yeah. So let's go ahead and start with first of all, any questions about upcoming assignments, tests, et cetera. We think sort of field. Now to head off confusion later. In terms of upcoming events in this lecture, quizzes will, we should be keeping up as you've got the essay, short essay. Again, sort of a page long essay. And the peer response due next Thursday and the following Tuesday. And then there'll be an exam on the early modern period. And the last exam will be the final, and that will be cumulative. The essay ink functioning on either the assignments page drew or is it perhaps not functioning on the general class schedule page? Those are the two places I would think to find the most directly if it's not popping up in your calendar as do assignment. Right? So written assignments and the assignment page, or also on the class schedule page, there's a link on the dates do as well. So those are going to place, you would go to find that. Another question for the final module for kind of be emphasized since won't happen, don't exam. There'll be a few extra questions. On module four goes to three classes. Yes, some slightly more emphasized. And start anthems format of both exam three and the final. There probably will be no essays. They will, they will probably be entirely multiple-choice exams along the lines of the multiple choice exams you hadn't last exam. But I should I thought I heard a question just now. Okay. And they're clarifications. Now, again, for variety of reasons, preparatory seems to be kind of an ethically comfort highest app, I guess, whatever it is. And I know a lot of my call to prefer not to use it instead. That's why the exams are veered toward these kind of multiple, multiple choice questions with different answers in them to make them a little bit more subtle and difficult. So no factorial won't be used. They will be OpenNotes. Exam, as you've had before, where your canvas pages and your notes that you take from these lectures are the kind of primary materials you can work from. Breathing meaning. Okay, for your patients and your questions has really kind of shuffle around some of the assignments and format a suit the online format of this class. I appreciate your patience with that. Let's move into today's lecture. We were talking about some of the interactions that happen between Europe and pen in the early modern period. So you had as one of your object ports to pay a set of two different six candle folding screen. And it's made around 610610 ish. And these are called non-bonding screen, southern foreigner screens. And what I want us to start off class with in terms of a kind of discussion is to just to some close looking at the screens. And it may help you to open them in your browser so that you can look at them in more detail and zoom in on some of the details. So I want you to look at the screens closely and trying to get by some of the things that are happening in them. And based on these details, what are these screens about? Who might they be four or kind of a message or they conveying throw these little vignettes and interactions that you can see. So once you've looked at the, the image is closely, go ahead and make some observations in the chat window. And I'll occasionally flip back and forth between these two screens so that you can see them display broadly here. But again, it may be helpful if you open them in a separate window. Okay. Yeah. A lot of you are really getting the sort of general tenor of what is going on. But I would encourage individual moments where you can see specific kinds of interaction to try and talk about details as well. Mm-hm. We have a variety of different reactions and a variety of different details that you're all focusing on, which give us the kind of data for trying to describe what exactly is happening in these images. So again, the most general way to describe the most of you head on, and this is a movement of exchange rate. As Diana pointed out, you have compositions that are divided really by land and sea. So it's ashore scene, right, where you have these buildings and architecture among these Golden Clouds and these people standing on firm ground. And then you have the dark waters to the left in this image. And a ship with its sales up in this image, as Daria pointed out. And then unfurled in, the following image, tended to sort of sell out of the scene. But again, in this, in this screen and in the other screen, a kind of general division in half of the ocean or the Bay into which the chip has sailed, and the land on which people are seeing to interact. And as many of you generally describe, this is a scene of interaction, right? Between a really diverse group of people, I think as has been pointed out. And that diversity is signaled in a variety of ways. Matt pointed out the clothing often differs. Maggie was talking about how there's A man riding on an elephant in one of the images that obviously distinguishes him from those around him. But the diversity of signals as well, in terms of diversity of ethnicities and skin tones and skin colors. Here in this unpacking scene, you see a variety of exotic striped animals and winged creatures and boxes being unpacked on the shore. And you have a variety of sailors. These are Portuguese sailors, instance of different North African, Mediterranean and European descent. And they're distinguished by these Panta loons, right? These big breaches that expand from the waste and then contracted the ankles. Most of you are probably too young to remember, hammer pants, but that was a thing. Certain 990s, this style came back into vogue. Here, of course, you're talking about the early 17th century, the late 16th century, when these would have been formal wear for the Portuguese. Somebody noticed that a few of these people are bearing weapons threat. Particularly the men who have these sort of canopies over them, who seemed to be distinguished in one way or another up from the rest of them by extra hats. And these are Portuguese traders and there were also distinguished by these callers are these big white ruffled collars, which was Common Court attire for Portuguese in and around this time. So we're getting diverse people, diverse animals, and diverse number of different jobs in this kind of unloading process where the ships are coming in to harbor for exchange. And you get a sense of the kind of excitement, right? And the exotic nature of this chips arrival. Not just through the diverse kinds of physiognomy, diverse sorts of features of these people painted on his Japanese screen. At least one of you thought that this was a Chinese screen and this is a Japanese screens. So we should be clear about, about that. And the spectacle has also figured in some of the acrobatics that you see happening between the various masts and rope scaffolding on the ship. People climbing up, people doing acrobatics, flipping off of them, sliding down their legs. This is a scene of spectacle, right? Foreign trade, exotic objects, exotic people from a Japanese perspective and spectacle. But as one of you pointed out, there's religious spectacle going tucked in a, in the details. And those of you who thought sort of about the broader composition, right? So Diana was talking about the kind of general half composition between land and water. Colton and talked about the idea that you have a lot of sort of frozen scenes here all kind of linked together in this landscape. Which reminded him of Jane Co. or you could think about it as a kind of, you know. A hen scroll like the name for the LA River. I just laid out with a diverse group of characters, right? There's no repeating characters in this religious aspect is a fascinating 11 of the things that we want to be focusing on. The introduction of Christianity from Europe into Japan at this time in part helps us to date when these screens are painted. They're not dated with an inscription. But based on the kinds of interaction we are seeing celebrated here, one of you, the fact that there isn't a sign of conflict happening, right? Nobody's fighting here. This is a genie awe interaction between the Japanese and the Europeans. And they're distinguished by clothing and by hairstyle. Often right here you have two Japanese kneeling at an altar in which you have, which is a little ambiguous in the emitter. And it could be a picture or it could be an actual person. But you have a, a man with a beard and European features and across a variety of Western figures in robes, kneeling and paying homage to this figure at the altar, a Christian image. But notice in the background you have a set of screens that are painted with an ink landscape, something we associate much more with the decorative arts of Japan, Korea, and China. These figures here in the somewhat more reserved robes and that sort of trapezoidal hat's being accompanied by figures in typical but common Japanese robes are priests, Catholic priests. And then in the cupola of some of these buildings, you see further reference to religion. There's a dove here at the top of this crossed element and a floating figure, much like figure here, with a cross on some clouds and a little altar in the olive it below this otherwise Japanese detailed, elaborately detailed building. And so we're getting a sense that these foreigners are not only bringing with them exotic goods, different kinds of clothing, and contrast them to their local japanese sort of people that they're interacting with. But also embedded in this is a set of ideas associated with Christianity. And that is one of the things that we want to be focusing arm with, with the screens. And again, throughout the lecture we'll think about format. We'll come back to these screens a couple of times to speak about some of the details as we associate them with. The arrival of Portuguese traders in Japan and how that arrival was depicted and screens like these two screens. But overall, if we're going to characterize these screens, it is a harbors seen, seen from a kind of elevated perspective in which foreign ships are sailing into the harbors of Japan to trade in exotic materials and in ideas like Christianity or exotic animals, of course, as well. Now just to sort of frame us temporarily, right, in terms of our Japanese history, right? Our first object that we looked at in the sorted sequence of events, a sequence of time with, with Japan was the Chaka triad. And we talked about the rival and celebration of Buddhism by the aristocratic court. And the prints that is supposedly sort of visualised in the sculpture that is otherwise up, up a Buddha. We know this again from the inscription on the back. Next, when we were in Japan, we were in the hay on period, this period of relative stability and a kind of aristocratic court art, flourishing of Japanese style aristocratic court arts including calligraphy, narrative, storytelling with the Taleb Kenji, and the walk-up poems as well in these hands close to illustrate the table of, again, we talked about this major transition moment, right? With again, pay wars in which you have a new style of government where the Shogun, it's in charge and the emperor sits as more of a ceremonial figure. When we sort of next looked at Japan, it was during the Common Core a period. And we've talked about this diverse styles of Buddhism that were practice in each of these images. And at this point, when we are intersecting with this set of screens, there is a period of a rule called the Momo period in the middle of the 16th century. And it won't be on the period or it goes sort of 16th century in general is, and pick it up. Chris, this unity and then reunification. And again, this is a kind of common theme that we keep talking about politically and economically throughout our art. A course this semester. In the beginning of the 16th century, the rule of Japan and really disintegrated in doing these kinds of local DIYbio rule. And remember Dimeo are the heads of various major clams, land-owning clans in Japan. And the Shogun it, this person who is the Shogun remember, is supposed to be ruling over all of Japan had become increasingly weak. As you'll remember, the From the last time we were in Japan, the emperor in the 14th century go, I go, had tried in instigate a kind of rebellion and we assert rule and that led to this divided rule, north and south. And increasingly throughout Japan. The centralized rulership, both North and South, becomes disintegrated into local. And this led to a lot of conflict and political people that there's a population, increasing economic exchange and increasing urbanization happening throughout japan. Populations bring cities are growing even though the kinda far more locally ruled and organized. And in this brief period that the desert zone kind of periodization, the 50 years or so, 45 years of the memorial period. It's, it's sort of kicked off by the collapse of this Shogun rule. And then the reunification through, of course, in a war and bloodshed and conquering each of the various other. Dimeo ruled provinces of Japan by a couple of generals that had served under the Shogun at Oda, Nobu knockout and time at home, we hit a OCI. And this concerted effort to reunify all of Japan through military conflict leads again to a lot people, a lot of disintegration and eventually the reunification of Japan in the late 16th century. You might remember a detail from our porcelain class that at the end of this, toward the end of this period, the general who was in charge of this kind of reunification process, toyota, me, Hideo, she gets the idea that he's going to continue as warpath into China to conquer China. This begins with the invasion of Korea. Hideo, she dies during an invasion of China from Korea. And after that point, the kind of bellicose nature of these rulers dies, dies down and Japan retreats back to the Japanese army's retreat back to Japan. And so it's a very tumultuous period with some grand ambitions obviously. And it leads to the last period of Shogun to rule the Edo period in which one of these other former generals was part of this campaign to unify Japan and then eventually try and conquer the mainland. Gentleman named took a gala, Yasu solidify his claim to rule and establishes this new Shogun to under the same style for all these Shogun rule. In 1603, eventually leading to the stability of the empire. Now sequestered to Japan without these ambitions to conquer the rest of Asia. And part of the mentality of took our ASO. And they took the Shogun in general, was to isolate Japan from this sort of conflict that had been engaged with he Daoshi, his attempt to go invade Korea and Japan. And so there's isolationist policy. And these isolationists ideas too sort of cut off diplomatic ties with the rest of the world. Finally lead to peace in Japan. But it led also to a kind of limited interaction with foreign ideas and foreign peoples. You'll remember that this is the time when global trade is expanding across the world. From many of our perspectives, this begins with a kind of European age of exploration. Part of the reason why the United States are the way they are. For instance, as a result of this kind of exploratory expansionist and colonization policy based in Europe. And when it comes to East Asia, most of the European power, we're not interested in colonizing East Asia so much as trading and exchanging in exotic goods that turn a profit back in Europe or in any of the various colonies. And so sea trade really at the center of the agent variation rather than the trade overland routes which we've talked about before. And the port are really at the forefront of this. If we go back to the map friend Portugal, which we think of as a relatively small and not extremely influential political power these days, was during the 16th century. At the top of the European food chain, you could, you could save many of the trade routes for the Portuguese had established to Asia went all the way around the Cape of Good Hope, at the tip of Africa in two and through the called the East Indies or South Asia, through the various islands that we now call Indonesia and the Philippines. And then eventually to China and Japan. And this is when our group of paintings here at the beginning of today's lecture were made. And this is, but they're visualizing the arrival of these trade ships from Portugal to Japan. The earliest record of portuguese first arriving in Japan and conducting trade is in 1543. And we might think of the exchange as being entirely about bringing exotic East Asian goods back to Europe directly. But there was a lot of local trade happening as well. Just like the Silk Road was composed of a series of kind of depots where you traded things from one d power city to the next and continually kinda picked up goods along the way. The East India Trading routes for the europeans operated similarly. And so many of the goods that are being braided in Japan by the Portuguese actually originated in China or in India. And things brought from Japan initially were actually, one of the main things brought back to Japan initially was silver, which was used for currency. In Europe. This is a long and arduous trip. It took a long time, and it was an expensive endeavor. And usually only about one ship a year. I made this journey. And so that might give you at least some understanding of what kind of a spectacle at was in Japan to have that chip of foreigners are arrived with all of their exotic goods picked up along the way along the coast of Africa, along coast of India, through the Philippines and Indonesia, which were not called that at this time. Eventually arriving and Japan. With this expansion of trade comes the expansion of missionary work. Partic eight by the Jesuits, One of the missionary orders of the Catholic Church. And in 1549 and the first Jesuit missionary to arrive, and Jim and Francis Xavier puts his feet down there and begins to try and establish roots for the Catholic Church in Japan. And these Jesuits, their mission really was directly to help to spread the word of the Catholic Church in foreign, foreign lands. And they come about really as a result of getting out. Many of these Jesuits were highly, highly educated people. They've learned Latin, Greek, as well as Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, and English. And then they would arrive in these foreign parts. And the first thing to do was to try and learn the language so that you could translate some of the main ideas and principles of religion. So again, every year you can think of, but the arrival of more of these missionaries transmission in Japan in the middle of the 16th century, trying to expand the Catholic Church. Of course, at this time back in Europe, those of you with a kind of European tear, the kitchen. Might understand why that's need to expand the Catholic Church, because this is the same times the reformation is happening, where you have Luther in Germany capping a kind of splinter with the Catholic Church over ideas about how the church should operate and what Christian faith was. Some of the successes had by these various missionaries included the conversion of some of these head, heads of families, the Dimeo. So the DIYbio at Nagasaki, a major trading port on the coast of Japan, was a full Christian convert. And he was interested in all of the ideas coming with fees traders from Europe and established a specifically pro-Western trading port, fair. And this meant that these Catholic mission areas, I had a kind of a friend in Nagasaki. By 1582, just a mere 30 plus years after the first Jesuit arrives. In Nagasaki alone, there are estimated to be over a 150 thousand converts to this new foreign religion, including some Dimeo, including various summary as well. And this but we're getting is a port, perhaps Nagasaki app, where you're getting all of the kind of welcome arrival of these missionaries, right? You see is the establishment of these churches with their religious iconography coming from abroad. But within a local language of architecture, you're getting the diverse group of people and exotic goods being displayed as well. But in a format and in a kind of painting which we'll talk about in a minute, that was distinct, the Japanese. The word bribe these screens generally at Southern foreigners, not just used to describe the Portuguese. Foreign trade. In these ports constituted a variety of different origin. Nations for these ship, including various South Asian traders as well, which called Southern foreigners. Basically anybody non-Japanese coming from South Asia, Africa, Europe was labeled with this term, now unbutton southern foreigners. And here you can see the distinction again between those sorts of types of people based on clothing, based on physiognomy appearance, and based on habit as well. Excuse me. Let's see. So. And to think about when we ask ourselves, who are these made for is the fact that the format of these screens, folding screen, the Bilbo, is one that's distinctively made for. Japanese interiors and the composition of the image itself with its elevated perspective, which you've seen from the tail again G. With the lack of a kind of horizon line into which are our eye disappears with landscape seems to disappear. The use of these highly patterned surfaces, or Notice that the goal, if you've done the clouds, merges in a way, the clouds with the land and this reflective surface that is set off by the non-reflective or less reflective paint, colors of the water and the figures itself. These are strategies of image making that you've seen with earlier aristocratic art in Japan. And that we call Japanese style painting. And there's an increasingly await us. This mode of painting in Japan was specifically for Japanese audiences. And the term ya motto a or Japanese style painting is applied through these paintings that have these general features at around this time. This particular set has unattributed author or painter named Cano is in. And he wasn't number one of the most prestigious painting families in the M. And the lineage of Kono painters begins just before this period. The more remote she period when you have that sort of split rural north and south. And these painter, this sort of family lineage of painters particularly ends up painting for the emperor and then for the Shogun as well. And these imperial or Shogun to Commission's help to elevate the family painting lineage to the most important painting lineage in, in Japan. And that being the head of the household has handed down for over four centuries. They establish various satellite, I guess. I'll stores of academies in the major cities of Kyoto and a dough which is Tokyo. And they particularly choose formats that are favored by the wealthy, of course. Large folding screens that are meant for the interiors of castles, as well as an important monasteries number. The Buddhist church is a main sponsor of the arts and there's lots of money in the Buddhist church. The system of kind of repeated motifs that were memorized by young caught a school. We're particularly crafted for the repetition of these ideas about rulership, about power, and about exchange that we might see in the newborn screens are and a variety of other screens made by the same painting lineage. And again, this format of painting is, might seem strange to you, right? It's not one we've encountered so far. Some hand scroll. You don't move through it like you would a hand scroll. That's a single small image that you can focus on like the Jin Ko image. Instead, these are almost wall size images that have a dimension out to them in the way that they break, increase along these panel hinges. They're about the size of a person, a little bit shorter, usually. And they're meant for interiors like this. This is an interior that was fully painted by another of the Kano School Master's kind of time you group of paintings was painted for the Emperor's, begins at this castle in the middle part of the 17th century. And the sliding screens that are these sort of able pieces more painted by people like kinda Tanya, kinda niacin, as well as the kind of folding screens that we are looking at in this class. And they would have to break up the interior of these large audience halls in which people actually sat or kneeled. And so unlike a kind of European audience, are loyal audience hall. The mode of interaction was kneeling, are seated rather than in stable chairs. That brings the height of everything image wise down to about half of a person's body height. And so kneeling in front of an image like these, they would be well above your head. Interacting with them. Kind of face, arm. And as the emperor or the Shogun or the various Dimeo sat in a room like this. Paintings behind them would be reflecting the light with all of the gold foil. Whether it's natural light from an app, if it's an oxide facing audience hall or candlelight, there'll be flickering off of all of this bodes leaf. And the motifs help to reinforce, Of course, the power of the person who is the sponsor of the audience hall. Whether that is the emperor, the local DIYbio, the Shogun himself. Or again, whoever might be sponsoring our screen here, the number of foreigners screens. So most like this set screens. Was made for somebody who are supportive of this new Christian faith. And one of the reasons why we can date the screens to the early 17th century. What's that? Soon after the beginning of the 17th century. The tuple gala emperor told go, ask you, bans, proselytize ation the bands. These new Christian missionaries misfit some of the larger world view that he establishes as he becomes Shogun, which is of an isolationist policy. Keep out for, do you keep a foreign intervention, maintain the stability of Japan locally. And this attitude really does begin with these generals. In the late Ming, much a period like Hitoshi, before he dies as he's on his mission to go conquer China and for Korea, E is relatively anti missionary, anti-Christian in his term. He says for these Padres to come to Japan and to convert people to their ideal, their creed. Destroying these local fates such as Shinto, which is a local Japanese religion that we haven't talked much about, centered around places, topography and earth deities and Buddhist temples. As a hitherto unseen and unheard of thing. He was not for these missionaries. In 1597, just a year before he dies and his attempt to conquer the mainland, Hideo, she actually orders the crucifixion of a group of Franciscan monks and their Japanese converts, killing them for the practice of this foreign faith. So friends, monks, or just another order of these proselytizing Catholics coming from Europe. There's the Jesuits and there's the Franciscans. I either time took Wu Gao ASU has consolidated his power and is about to establish. And Shogun. He makes as part of imperial law the banning of Christian missionary work altogether. And so it goes underground at that point. It's done in secret churches. And there still is a missionary in Japan, mostly sponsored by local lords who might be sympathetic to the religion or who had converted already. This eventually a major rebellion in which 40 thousand Japanese converts to Christianity are killed in the late 16, thirties. And after this point, after his rebellion, which unum destabilise the empire, partly because of these foreign ideas of Christianity. Took with, I'll show when it doubles down on banning Christianity. And also. Bands, the particular people who brought Christianity to Japan, the Portuguese. And this sort of, this ends the Portuguese dominance of trade with Japan. And instead of banning altogether, however, they took Ogallala. Shogun, allows for trade to happen only with the duck. Because the Dutch are not trying to proselytize. They're only interested in trade. May not send any missionaries, and they just wanted to exchange foreign goods. And that foreign trade as part of this isolationist mentality, is limited to only one location off the coast of the city of Nagasaki. And a little island that was actually a manmade island constructed specifically for these trade purposes called deci month. And so from the onward, all four are action is really only sourced and coming through this little pinhole of a kind of, of a, of a, of a source location, right? There's manmade island, coast of Nagasaki, dsigma. And so again, coming back to our screen, it becomes obvious that this screen Can't have been made much after 16 tens. Because after this point, persecution of Christian imagery and Christian celebration in Japan, that's gone full tilt, destabilize the Japanese government. And so this kind of imagery which as you rightly noted, show no conflict, that shows a kind of peaceful trade with the Portuguese. You know that by the way in which they've dressed and because of the Christian imagery. And after that point have to Shimon Bar rebellion, especially this would not have been possible. Trade with the Dutch. Really begins to expand after the banning of Portuguese traders. And again is isolated to this little island confession on here's a map of how small this manmade island of decimal was both upon these lengths in the Shuttle harbor of Nagasaki with this one bridge and Gateway to the mainland. And this is part of a larger Dutch East India Company, Dantian of world trade. We talked a little bit about the ways in which the Dutch East India Company helps us to sort of signify and in many ways, the changes of the early modern period. It was not a company that was beholden to any crown. It, what it most E, instead of multinational corporation, really is the best way to think about it. In today's terms. Shareholders were issued stock in these trading venture. If a ship sank the US, me, if a ship in back and they profited from their investment in the trade when all of the goods were sold. And the Dutch East India Company establish a variety of different trading footholds throughout their trading route. Including along the coast of India through what is now Indonesia and the Philippines. And what was at a certain point called Dutch Batavia actually. And eventually into Japan and China as, as well. And this exclusive contract really that you can about the Dutch East India Company having with Japan meant in part that the Dutch dominated European trade with Asia from the 17th century to the 18th century. Over that time, almost 5 thousand ships go from Europe to Asia. At large. I helped to build the Dutch Empire. Ends applied Europe where various spaces, t's porcelain. Kicking off a fad or fashion for all Chinese, which we'll talk about next class, I believe. And of course on the Japanese side of thing, things, there's this fascination with foreigners still, Especially because they're not limited to this one place where you have a number of about 60 buildings, only about 15 thousand square meters of total land. One ship is arriving ICI. And mainly what they're trading with the Japanese is Chinese goods in spices in exchange for Japanese silver, gold, and copper, which then makes its way back to Europe to fuel some of the expansion of colonies elsewhere like the Americas. So everything becomes knit together through these kinds of trading Ventures. And our little window onto that. For the moment is Japan. I kinda dense amount of information and then stop and take a drink of water. And ask you a basic comparison between the image, one of the images that we just looked at and our sect, which this etching and engraving made in Japan just slightly later point by Japanese artist. Think about composition and image. What are the differences you see between the images? How are they constructed visually in contrasting ways? Looking back, comments, thanks for the one up on Hammer Time. I appreciate that. Tyler. Why were they not call just foreigners? That basically was the word for foreigners, nun bun, or in or southern, southern barbarians. The idea that there are better being rooted in the fact that they don't local culture. All right, so we're already getting some comparisons between these two is let's grow a few more before we move into a group discussion. Great ordinate. So these are images constructed for different sets of basic principles about how it is. You're supposed to look at a landscape, right? These are both landscape images in a way, but they focus on different things and they're constructed based around where the different principles as John started us off and Zach, right? The difference really here is between a horizon line gives me a tough one to get out for some reason. A horizon line that breaks the middle of the image into brick at the top. And the lack of a horizon line at all in the image at the bottom, what's called a bird's eye view. And as Ethan said, you gotta kinda, you're getting a kind of flattened image versus an image of perspective and visual depth in the tree limb Brooke. Print added the fact that you get value added in the tweet them. Brooke, print tripe, meaning shading. So bidding a highlight on the edge of the roof here and a darker edge here. And the shadow cast somewhat confusingly along the edge. This rich as well with dark lines behind the highlight ridges. Somehow a kind of brightened corner over here and darker corner here. I'm ditto, the same in regards to kind of hides under the eaves here. This is in shadow and this is in light. And these figures are casting shadows as well. Whereas our fingers here are not casting any shadow. There's no light source being referred to here. Whereas here, in general, you get the sense the light source must be from somewhere outside of the image in order to cast the shadow in this direction. Excuse me, excuse me. Not to see. Harrison mentioned diminishing scale, which are getting in terms of the people, right? The people closest to you or larger and for further away are smaller, which helps to give you that sense of depth, the ero focusing on so, so well. Whereas in this image, all the figures are more or less the same size, rather sort of brought up into our view manure, bird's eye perspective as you, as you put it. So that we can kinda linger with each group of people to see what they're up to. We have a kind of, oddly are bird's eye view on all of these things. Whereas as Ben described, the image in the upper left, the two Luneburg image is more realistic as we tend to think of the visual strategies of Western realism, which include a horizon line, which include value and shout out to show cast light, which gives you a time of day. And the sense of a stilled moment. You have diminishing scale or recession of scale. So that you feel like you're standing in an actual place with the horizon line disappearing away from you. So an image like this helps you feel grounded in images if you're staring through window into an actual place, right? And Ben mentioned the sky as well with a kind of a different way of constructing the clouds with value. A little less attention to highlights. Whereas the clouds here are these sort of stylized, flattened, patterned gold spaces. And so each of these is asking us to that in a really different way. You might think about format to the folding screen is almost a kind of Free State architecture in a formal space within the Japanese architectural environment that it, that it was made for. This print is a handheld image. You could frame of print, but often print at this time were circulated. Much like manuscripts or books. Or, and you kind of, you can peer into it as if you're peering into a window onto a specific place at a specific time. Dave? Whereas this is a more general scene in which we're focusing on the kinds of qualities of activities. One of the things that diary I mentioned that goes along with Harrison's idea of diminishing l is that we can't really tell what these figures are up to as they get smaller away. And that makes this much more in a place. Place which is labeled up at the top in Dutch. Versus being in an genre scene where the interaction that people are more important, the place, although it's likely not Asahi or another major trading hub before the shutdown. Of Portuguese trade. Place doesn't matter as much to this image the interactions matter. Create that was a really productive set of comparisons. And what we want to focus on expected with this image on the left is that the artist making it who was Japanese, is deciding to implement an experiment with difference for ImageNet is compared to the painter kinda magazine for the set of screens. And particular strap. We might folk songwriters, the use of perspectival lines. And this is a staple of Renaissance image-making in Europe that comes to Japan and China through European contact. About perspectival lines do at, through a hards, through Harvard straight lines that are understood to be parallel to one another that direct you instead to a point on the horizon. They allow you to feel like you're in a real space where I would normally disappeared to horizon more parallel. Especially in architecture, curve toward the horizon rather than stand in parallel as they actually are in space. And that vanishing point and again established, establishes a simulation of ocular perspective. It imitates in many ways the functions of our eye. And if you compared the facts that done here, Shiba coca and the artist is playing around with some of these hards perspective lines where these lines seem to be the architecture there should be parallel to one another, but they seem to be disappearing to a vanishing point somewhere on the horizon over here. And this hard line of window stalls along the roof line draws our eyes back similarly to some horizon point over on the edge or beyond the image here. On the edge here shown to them, Brooke is the same as the real Guo Qu bridge. That's the Japanese name for the same bridge shown Japanese print. And if you look at the of around the same time really. And if you look at the parallel lines here of the structures underneath that support the bridge, they remain parallel to one another, right? They don't draw you two horizon line. And what that does is it keeps you stuck in the front of the painting where you get to look at all of these fun and interesting interactions between boats of entertainers and courtesans. And boatman all kind of yelling, yelling at each other as they crash into each other. This is about a kind of clustered event in which fireworks are actually going off in the background. Holiday in Japan. And in comparison down here, again, we're not lingering on what's happening in the foreground. Instead, we were in a place that is about the kind of topography, geography of the space more than it is about the fraction of the people. So I've aligns with one of the things that Shiba cold calling is playing with. Another thing that he's interested in, in terms of ocular ideas about how to construct spit comes up in a reading. So one other chat prompt for today as to look at these readings and based on the journal entries at the same artist who gives us this print. How worried these images, again with they're really different kinds of perspective, their modes of constructing space and typography. How are they received according to Shiba co calm by when Japan, what made them different or strange? So write that down, I get my watch to make sure I don't go out of time for flowers. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hm. Right, you gotta drawing on some of the great details of the, of these two excerpts. And so let's go over the reading in relationship to the image. And one of the excerpts from the reading specifically sites the image that we're looking at three local bridge print. So you gotta write, he's basically the people who are looking at is images and not favoring them. People of OSU in particular, he calls the Moran's. He says you just you're not getting what I'm what I'm what I'm thrown down here. You're stubborn and opinionated. And as many points out, these were sort of people that were not used to the images and didn't know how to interact with them, right? And GPa Khan who says, well, I've actually been giving these kinds of images to temples and to shrines in areas like Kyoto, which is west of o shoe. But here in this more provincial place, people are wedded to their old ideas about how images should look. That is kind of bird's eye perspective flatten patronized landscapes that we can associate with things like the painted screens. And another important detail here other than this kind of regionalized awareness of different modes of image making is that donating these two temples and to shrines as well. So he's getting not only from urbanites in Kyoto, but also from the various religious organizations that are experimenting with and perhaps interested in this new mode of visualization as well. And he's painting plates as and oil paintings like. So not just the Prince of places like Mount Fuji, famous geographic sites in Japan. But one of the things that Daria focus on was the fact that he calls this the Dutch method. And that's important for us too to engage with and think about. Because all four learning at this point is coming through with a Dutch tray, you can say, or through, through kind of a Dutch. It's an anything foreign is basically called Dutch, Dutch learning, including these myths and these methods of constructing images with perspectival lines, with oil paints, and with copper plate printing, which we'll talk about in just a minute in the second description, right? You're getting a very different scene with the country folk of oh sure, who don't get the Dutch methods. And a brothel. Where you're being entertained by 12 or 13 Women, which embarrasses me sort of bears to be in the bra, to be entertained, but he's embarrassed that he has so many people paying attention to him. There was a kind of abrupt gang maybe going on here as well. Footnote to all of this and we'll discuss this in two classes from now. Being in a brothel doesn't mean that he was having sex necessarily. He could have paid purely for company and Entertainment, which was the more likely option and Japanese brothels at this point. And he uses his new imagery is sort of novel ideas, right? To break the ice. These women who he's paying to have the company. To make him feel less awkward. He brings these things out and he says that they're astonished, instigates this whole level of conversation that didn't exist before. And he says specifically, that is using another instrument, right? So we've talked about oil painting. We've got in the image or in the excerpt above, we've got the fact that he's making prints like the ones that he's showing here in another technology of copper plate and Tim. And he's also using a camera obscura device like the one shown here. It adds an extra sense of emerging into the image. Rather. It a, how to say it accentuates. The perspectival structures though. Are that you are standing in front of a window looking onto his space around which European modes of constructing image sort of centered. A camera obscura heightens that effect with a focusing lens and reflecting mirror. So here are some images of, again, the Japanese camera obscura. One that was likely, yeah, by xi will cook on or some of his compatriots at around this time. And images of how that a camera obscura can generally work. You can create a camera obscura with a box, right? As this person is doing, he's tracing a scene from the outside world. Because when the image pass the light from the outside world passes through the lens and reflects off of the mirror onto the paper. You can trace that image, much like this room. Artist Bella Morado, I think is his name, is using a lens to construct sort of a projected image of what lies outside of the window and Venice here onto the white wall. And it reverses states. So this is why you're going to lose gang or copying image upside down in both of these are illustrations of how camera obscura works. In this sort of handheld model. What you're doing is you're putting down for his friends at the brothel, right? To look at their local bridge, print and be put here that you would look for the lenses if you were looking into the scene, it would heighten that effect of the perspectival lines drawing you into the image. And so in many ways he's using foreign technology and foreign modes of constructing image. To distinguish himself from various other artists at the same period. And one of the other aspects that we want to focus on is that the real itself, copper plate engraving. The method is also new and rare in Japan and it comes from the west as well. So this is not made with woodblock printing, but with a copper plate. And we know that experiments with transferring images from copper plate print that had come via the Dutch. Perhaps in woodblock print. Here's a woodblock print of Venice, a place that due to gala total HOW TO, had never been to in the 17 seventies. Remember, there's an isolationist policy that almost exactly copies the composition. Minus the clouds, minus some of the shipbuilding. And other techniques that you picked up on that in the Shiba coke on print is copying almost exactly this Italian print of just a few decades earlier, which also tells us that the transmission of images like this, venice are made for a European audience in the 17 forties to Japan was relatively quick. And people like Shiba co Khan would look at images like this. And rather than transmitting them into woodblock prints, he was interested in, in the method itself of copper plates. Engraving. Discussed block printing before. And the method, the method of creating the woodblock and transferring the image and printing etcetera. Copper plate dating is more involved at the basic material level. You need a large press rather than just the sort of hand press technique of woodblock printing. You need a metal, it's a copper pipe, is expensive frame. You need to be using acid baths in metal etching tools in order to etch the plates to begin with. And it's a much more expensive method from the start. Not to mention the fact that rather than anything, what lays on the top. Well, hold on. How am I going to put this thinking method is slightly different, right? So I hear you have carved away from the surface, the negative space of the image. And what lays up is inch and becomes the printed image. Here. The carving technique. And through the use of acid bath and the metal stylus is etched into this fence. That whole thing as England and the excess ink is wiped off. So what is raised is actually your negative space. As you can see in the transfer of this copper plate to the inked image as well. So conceptually there's some differences as well in terms of how you construct your image and how you build it in the material itself. So all of these things that are being used by Shiba co Khan, and they're all coming through again, this one narrow access point. Of the island off the coast of Nagasaki. And the interest in Dutch techno gene, what was called around GAAC or Dutch learning among people like Shiba, cocaine resulted in these new novel modes of producing images. They're confused and confounded. People. You get images of various kinds of foreigners. Here is with the Dutch supposedly looks like and remember, most people in Japan never would have met an actual foreigner there. I did just to this island. You get new kinds of technology like a microscope and anatomical predecessor bringing from Europe that were directly copied from the European origins into woodblock prints for Japanese audiences. In Japanese doctors really owe our friend he or she will call con, gets his early training actually in the same kind of painting that the folding screens is done for Kano school of painting. He later tries on various Chinese styles and then sort of experimenting with everything, including oil painting, including copper plate prints. And he is among the first to actually use that technology in Japan and has access to Ron VOC or Dutch learning is strain that we know from his diaries that he only ever visits Nagasaki. Where the ducks learning is coming from off the coast from that little island. Does Schumer, we only ever visited once relatively late in his experiments with these various kinds of Dutch learning. And so this means that he has access to these things regardless of his existence, geographically close to their origin point. With the access to Dutch learning comes an explosion and variety of different bits of your pin thinking, not just optics, which we've talked about with the print and with the camera obscura, but also medicine. Here's a painting he's done with the sort of legendary sage of Chinese medicine and the sort of counterpart within Japanese history. And then with, I believe it's Silenus who creates this illustrated anatomical guide. And he's put them altogether fish around a table. That is about the meeting of China, Japan, and the West. This point at this painting is Incan and copper on silk, which you can see little aspects of the kinds of shading and perspective that he's learned from these Dutch treatises and this Dutch illustrations. It is a world map that is engraved and printed on parchment that is offered by xi pecan. So ideas about how you pay make maps are coming from this little narrow passage of Western learning into Japan as well. And here's an example of one of his oil paintings. Of barrel makers painted, as you see, silk rather than on canvas, which are linen which would have been painted on it in Europe. So it's image, although it seems relatively sort of basic and many ways to us, is innovative, fresh and confounding to Japanese eyes at this time. And it's the result of all of these technologies coming in from Europe that come with Dutch learning, or so-called Dutch learning. And just to sort of expand out toward enroll module theme rapid. Many of the things that we've talked about in this class, in the last couple of classes are factors that we're, we're, we're identifying with the early modern period and what it means to be moderate rate in Europe, we assessed this with a particular period and the Renaissance and the secularization of knowledge. Up until the French Revolution, where you have changes in government and economy. We talk about printing, technology, science, and secular politics separated from the church. The rise of nationalist ideal. As opposed to again, a kind of religiously based sense of connectivity to people or a locally based village kind of mentality. And these various complicated non-state economic powers interacting like the Dutch East India Company of court, modernization of Europe is also the result of this global expansion and colonization and taking advantage of many other places in the world as well. So if we try and graph it on to East Asia, what are the things tenants right? Printing technology existed well before secular politics, we can talk about the move away from the church in China as early as the 11th century, tenth century. Some thick ideas existed in different wavelengths and parameters as well as in Japan. And so do you have to have a kind of interaction with Western powers to create the kind of early modern idea that we associate with European history. Where does nationalism fit in? And these questions will begin to kind of uncertain later clap as, as, as well. But we can think about again, the role of global foreign relations, right? And what limits, and the limits that and that interaction can again, during this period, there is a strict isolation as policy. That means at foreign interaction is happening for very narrow opening at this one little city. Especially after the Dutch through takeover dot trade from the Portuguese were thrown out for trying to proselytize. So our Foreign Relations conducted. What are the kind of basic precepts are ideals that under, under, underscore for that. And this introduction into how nations and countries interact. Another part of what maybe qualify as the early modern period and carries over even into our present moment. Alright, that's enough for today. I've got a little bit over. I apologize. But thank you for being with me and hope you have a nice evening. I have office hours at the end of the day if you want to talk about anything. Thank you. Sir.



## [16. Europe and China](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/16-europe-and-china?module_item_id=2446634)
 Why? All right, let's go ahead and start class. Before we jump in. Last in any any questions about work do coming up or the rest of the semester, et cetera. As you know, your essays, your second assays are due Thursday. So I will get to those soon. Then your peer reviews will be assigned automatically by Canvas the following day. If you fail to do your essay on time, you do not get assigned a peer review. You can email me, I'll directly assigning one. But make sure to get your essay is done. There is no wiggle room this time they're do when they're due, which is tomorrow, Thursday. Sorry. That's right. And the peer reviews Julian, will be due on Tuesday, Again, the same same as the assets off the hard deadline. Cotton's asking about factorial. Oh, no, I am deciding not to use factorial the whole class, but there won't be any essays on the final exam. And I'm considering using past exam material, which again you have access to an exam is completed on the final, which would help to simplify your studying processes. Some have made a decision on that yet, but the final is cumulative. There will be no Proctor, Mario, there will be OpenNotes, and there will be no essays. Alright, that's it for questions to start off with. Again, you can always come to my office hours or email me with other questions. Coming to office hours is actually preferred, gives me somebody to talk to. Alright? So Europe and China still again in our early modern period. And instead of thinking about Japan and Europe as we did last class, we're going to shift focus to think about what's happening in the early modern period in terms of interaction between European powers and the Chinese in China. So we're gonna start off with a basic visual comparison. You have these two main works for today. And just compare and contrast them. How are they different? And what do they have in common? Exercise your eyes and exercise your writing with these two images. Oh, wow. Mm-hm. Oh. We could probably start with here, as many of you said. One way in which these things are similar as if they are both giving you a kind of out door perspective on a group of architectural elements, right? The one above, however, is seen as if there's, it's populated with no actual people, right? It's, it's empty of figures which both Jenny and we're talking about and several others of you. It justice about the architecture. And there's Matt started to software. There's this sort of hard symmetry right up the middle of the image on top, where it appears that mostly to the left and the right you have a mirroring of objects and structures with very slight differences. Perhaps. Whereas by contrast, the image at the bottom is a little bit more hustle bustle right there, figures that are the focus of our attention. And again, many of you wrote about this. I jotted down a few notes. I think Jenny wrote about it. I think several other folks mentioned it. But really the folks at the bottom is a kind of activity that fills the architectural space and fills the landscape space. And the activity, according to the title right, is a market scene, so things being traded and exchanged and the architecture is just really a kind of backdrop for that to take place. Whereas the image above is entirely about really a portrait of the architecture devoid of people. We're not even sure what goes on with this particular kind of building, right? Were given very little hint about that because there are no people interacting. As several of you talked about us ahead. Drew, talking about this, and I think a few others. The perspective is in both of them established by a horizon line, although you can't see it in the image at top, there is a horizon line that cuts through the middle of the image almost exactly get along that kind of central axis horizontally, just as there's a central vertical axis, giving us a kind of sense of stilled space, right? Whereas here you can actually see the horizon line. You can see the atmospheric precession in terms of these buildings backyard being of a slightly dimmed or less. Intense tone of color. The sky itself fades from a blue to a kind of lighter color as well as you moved the background. And then there's scale that helps to establish it as well. But the figures in the foreground being much taller and larger than the figures in the background. But you do get a strong perspectival thrust for this diagonal opening between one side of the street and the other. Which is heaped up as many of you said, with this sort of group of objects for sale. And that drives your i all the way back to this sort of vanishing point masked by these objects in the foreground, the camel and the tropical palm trees. That's one thing. Another group, if you focus on the idea that the bottom image is full of color. And Jessica wrote about this end. And tropical tree is write these lush, vibrant sorts of vegetation. Whereas the trees and the image on topper controlled manicured and very much at a lesser focus of a lesser focus than the architecture itself. What plants there are seem to kind of fold and talk into the architecture as if they're supporting it. Here you have these wild palm trees and flowering plants lend a sense of kind of exotic exuberance to the scene itself, which is of, you know, silk and porcelain and various kinds of other goods just falling out of container. It's ready to be sold on the side of the street. And one interesting point that has just come up, Darja talks about the idea of luxury for the idea of both of these spaces, perhaps actually being about luxury goods or luxury architecture. And we'll get into sort of established for a minute. Let's see how would you talked about the image above are being in black and white as if it's an ink painting. It's actually a copper plate engraving. And the one at the bottom looking like, it's actually more like a Western painting. There's shading. There's a lot of sort of modeling of, and use of the drapery and shade in the drapery to give you a sense of the dynamism of the human forms. And the thing that seems perhaps Asian or Chinese about it is really the architecture at these tiled roofs with these lifted up eaves, pagodas in the background. And so the question really comes, especially when we look at the labels. How are both of these images describing China in a way in the middle of the 18th century because that's what both of them are meant to do. But if you look again closely at the inscriptions, you can begin to understand which audiences they might have been made for. The one above is made, the image itself is made for a Chinese audience, is made for the emperor by one of his officials in charge, particularly of visual material production in the palaces. Elon time. We'll get into him just a minute. And it's of a group of European style palace is made in Beijing for the emperor in the 17th, 18th century. Then the image below is made in France. But it's supposed to show us a similar scene to scene above. It's supposed to show us palaces and a market scene in China. And yet the image itself as how surmised as is constructed by Westerners with western modes of sort of how to put it, of composition, of shading, et cetera. And one of the things we want to think about in today's classes, how both of these support an idea of the other from the perspective of the person making. The image above, made for a Emperor of China in the 18th century. But depicting a group of palaces that were meant to appear as if they were in Europe, though they're built in China. And the image below a tapestry, so very different kind of image, the hanging wall weaving meant to show what Europeans thought of China in the 18th century, what they imagined it to look like when most of them had never been. So both of these are China, but they're made for different audiences and made with different sorts of data points, right, about what is being depicted and how China ought to look. So let's move to our, the first text and do a close reading. That as well. I've given you a couple of excerpts here from, from the reading. So how does Vilhelm Gottfried Leibnitz, who is a mathematician? Many of you might know him as mathematician, also philosopher, writer and historian. In some ways. He's a person who never went to China and yet he writes a whole book called The latest news from China, which was published first at the end of the 17th century. So according to Leibnitz, what is China like in the 17th century? Chinese customs? How do they compare to Europe? And then lastly, where do you think he got his ideas from? How does that affect the way he's writing about China as someone again, who never went there. And just as before, when you make a reference, the text try and include a quote that justifies your claims rather than jumping to the abstract, use a quote to try and prove what it is you're saying. Leibnitz thinks about China. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Mm-hm. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. You guys are all hitting on sort of core idea that I want you to take away from this are for eating. Which is that in the late 18th century, Wilhelm Leibnitz, Gottfried Leibnitz, who had never ever been to China, is taking this kind of authoritative voice about who the Chinese were and what their culture was like. And as several of you suggested, Ryan, Mindy, This is some sort of this is second-hand information and yet he's using it as if he knows about the place for art. And this sort of separation between primary experience and the sort of second-hand information that he's getting doesn't seem to bother him at all when he makes grand claims such as China is as refined as Europe. And both. You know, many of you pointed this out, Christina Ryan, et cetera. But he sees the more or less as equal. Each of them with their own sorts of strengths, right? On the one hand, you have Europe, which shows Christina and ran, both said is really valued and by Leibnitz as being the birthplace of a kind of more. Theoretical or mathematical kind of thinking. And he says, we are superior Tor, to China at this moment in these respects. And again, we might wonder, put a sort of asterisks on why it is that those are the things that he's focusing on. Whereas on the other hand, what he calls a practical philosophy and coltan and Matt talked about, about, about this, about the idea that there's some sort of, According to Leibnitz, ethical and practical philosophy in China, which makes them averse to war, which makes them his phone. And he really builds this off of a kind of contrast with the excessive interest in Europe on this technological disciplines, mathematics, military science as well. And as he says, where the Chinese subparts us, surpass us is in this basic structure of civil life, people treat each other as equals any, as many of you said makes comparison to Christianity. In, in that comparison, I think Matt talked about this and sort of as sorted Mindy. And almost as if to say, in this country where we are constantly or in this area were constantly at war with one another in Europe. But Chinese, at least from a far way he's seeing it right, appear to be a country full of peaceful, loving, apically oriented people and that helps to establish a kind of social order. So what exactly is he talking about and where does this information come from? This second-hand information that he's pointing out. Where are the primary sources for this? And we have to think about, again, this sort of idea that we end a, toward the end of last class with witches who is connecting these people and what are the mechanisms of connection as it direct trading as with the Portuguese and Japanese and then eventually the Dutch and the Japanese. Or is it other kinds of actual bright people, what we might think of as diplomats or as sort of interstate actors. And with this particular lecture, we're going to focus again on the Jesuits. But the situation here is quite different than in Japan where again, proselytizing and Christian missionary work was. And the people who are part, partook in it were kicked out. And that left Japan only to for the trade with and work with the Dutch. The Jesuits have a slightly different history in China and it's through the Jesuits that Leibnitz, his getting his information. It's through this. And the particular priorities of the Jesuits are to convert people to Christianity. And this leads to some of the information, again, that Leibniz is focusing on the idea that the Europeans are technologically, mathematically advanced. Culture. Even if they are quite war hungry, comes in part from what the Jesuits are telling him. And the idea that China is a peaceful, loving nation where war doesn't seem to happen, which we know is not true from the history that we've already covered, comes also from the bias that the Jesuits are putting on things. So, who were the Jesuits? It is the Jesuit Order. Society of Jesus was a religious order founded in the early part of the 16th century by someone who was later sainted. Ignatius of Loyola, given full papel approval to go on these missions in 1540 to convert people along these opening up trade routes with the rest of the world to Christianity. And they were missionaries in the sense that what they were trying to do was convert people and they serve under this motto, being those who desire to serve as a soldier of God. And so there are these sort of militaristic overtones, right? But the war that's being thought is over souls. And this is in part a response, as we discussed last time, to the European 16th century growth of Protestant belief systems and churches, the establishment of states that diverged from the Pope's authority, whether that's in England or in the north country is with the Netherlands, Germany, et cetera. And these Jesuit missionaries, or highly trained in Western classics, the Latin and Greek at a minimum, much. And then as well as their primary language. They were taught and of course, theology, the basic teachings of the Christian church and could read very often the original sort of source documents of much of the Christian faith, which at this point in Catholic liturgical process was always conducted in, in Latin. And they follow these modern global trade routes to go convert people in foreign countries. And we've talked about how they arrived in Japan and enjoyed about 50 or 60 year kind of moment there where they were converting Japanese Dimeo and locals, especially in these major trading ports. But fair presence in China, again, has a slightly different history. A few decades after the arrival of These Jesuit missionaries in Japan, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci, who had been based in Macau, which was a Portuguese trading port on the south coast of China. It moves inland to Nanjing, which as you remember, was the very first capital of the Ming dynasty before the capital was moved to Beijing. And it was still a major hub of trade and of wealth. And highly educated elites, families. And he focused especially on these highly educated elite, the literati are right, these people who come from well-to-do families who have influence and who are generally, as we've discussed, kinda conversing and interacting with one another through these references to classical Chinese texts, including Confucian texts. And this was one of the sort of reasons why people like Leibnitz back in Europe began to understand China as a place of a kind of civil and secular, semi-religious pizza confusion nation. That's, it's because the Jesuits, when they began convert people, they tried to focus on certain kinds of vocabulary that will be translatable into terms that already had local weight to them. And so many of the primary ideas in terms of Christian faith, when translated by these Jesuits originally into Chinese, co-opted and, and appropriated the terms of Confucianism. Especially in relationship to ideas about morality and if cultivating virtue. And in that way, those who would be curious about the Christian faith or being, it was being described to them in language that they were already familiar with in the priority venerated Confucian language just being shifted to tell different narratives and stories. And so when the Jesuits are writing back to Europe, one of the things that they are describing is that there is this sort of role of this secular, philosophical confusion mindset in establishing the order of the Chinese world. You know what's crucial to this in which becomes a kind of problem later, is the question of whether Confucianism counts, especially within Catholic eyes, are within Christianized as a religion or whether it's philosophy. And what are the differences between the two. And the Jesuits who were translating this information and sending it back to Europe to people like Leibnitz or to the Catholic church, or to the various kings of the European courts at this time were very much positioning Confucianism. As a philosophy rather than a religion, they were accommodating existing belief systems. And it's not altogether wrong. But what it helped to do was to establish the possibility of Chinese convert. Believing both in Confucian values if they're philosophical, as well as converting to in believing in the Christian faith. Whereas if the Confucian philosophies and ideas are considered to be of religious than they are in conflict with a belief in Christianity. You can only have one according to the Catholic Church. And this is called a, or at least the way the Jesuits were positioning Confucianism as a philosophy and accommodating that belief system in order to convert people to Christianity according to the terms by which you could be a Christian convert. This is called the combination strategy and it gets the Jesuits into trouble a bit later. But again, it's the root of why it is that people like Leibnitz conceive of the Chinese as these peace loving, moral, philosophically driven people. Because the Jesuits are telling them this more or less. Jesuits, again, are often not only highly trained in textual criticism, in languages and in reading, but also up also in Math, Astronomy, and these technical sciences, right, which gave them access to the courts when they arrive because they're bringing in new forms of science and technology that help the empire to maintain, for instance, its boundaries, right? Proper mapping creates proper boundaries which helps to establish empire, establish the realm. In its geographic terms. The Euclidean math helped in, particularly in astronomy, when we describe the ways in which the emperor's responsibilities were almost always to be able to kind of predict major catastrophes on the horizon. Dating all the way back to ancestor worship and ritual and the Shang dynasty. But if an eclipse wasn't predicted or a comment wasn't predicted, it could be a bad sign for the emperor. And it could create uncertainty in the emperor's power to rule. And so the new forms of astronomy that came in with the jazz widths, which by the way, came into Europe via the Islamic world, helped to help the emperor basically to do his job. And if we go back to Leibnitz's presumptions right, leads to this idea that the Chinese did not have math, that the Chinese did not have astronomy. They did. They just use different forms of is. And collaboration between the two led to new kinds of innovation in the Ming and Qing dynasties. In the way that the emperor did things like predict astronomical events or mapped his empire. And so the biases that are being given to Leibnitz are due to the fact that the Jesuits were saying. Here because of our technical skill. And we're converting as many people as possible. And the conversion is possible because these people don't have a religion per se. They have Confucianism, which as they say, is a philosophy. Whether Confucianism as a religion or a philosophy again, has been debated and you know, it's not for us to kind of come down one side, on one side or the other unless we repeat the kinds of debates at the Jesuits we're having. But suffice it to say from a European perspective, there was confusion because they were Confucian temples. They were Confucian rituals, which looked like religious practice. But the modes of Christian faith in terms of what constituted a kind of religious practice were lacking in many ways in the practice of Confucianism. So again, our Jesuits are a main conduit of knowledge from their arrival in the late 16th century. Really up until the 18th century. For all Europeans interested in Asia, I'm interested in China. And these the opening of the world that comes with the so-called European age of exploration. Where Europe discovered that there were these other places in the world, places which conceivably, as Leibnitz describes or unequal terms and have equal kinds of power, equal kinds of validity at two European powers. Now, in the 17th century, the Ming dynasty falls to the subsequent rulers of the Qing Dynasty, the last imperial dynasty in China. There was increasing instability, less of increasing, there was increasing population. The ability to bring in tax revenues was decreasing their reasoning. Just a general kind of disorder happening in the late Ming period. And then from the north there comes a kind of challenge wherein in the early part of the 17th century, a group of nomadic peoples, the Manchu, began to establish courts and empires that challenged the Ming and eventually conquered the entire geographic region of China controlled by beaming and even expanded the empire as they establish the Qing Dynasty, the last dynasty to rule, imperial rule o time period rural upper over China. And just like the Mongolian rulers of the Yuan Dynasty, is we're a people, a culture that was not steeped in Chinese ideas of Confucianism or ritual of ancestor worship, or even kind of bureaucratic organization. They were a non-Chinese people, the Manchu that came from the North, similar to the Mongolians. And therefore similar to the Mongolians. In order to rule over this massive population and geographic area, they adopted many of the kinds of cultures that we associate with Chinese rule, including adopting Confucianism, practicing different forms of Buddhism, et cetera. Taking Chinese names and brain names alongside their Manchu names and traditions. And warn of the sort of interesting outcomes of the Qing rule over China was really what we begin to think of as a and that ethnic empire. Just like in the Yuan Dynasty. Or you had large portions of people who had really been considered central to the Chinese Empire, brought into an incorporated into the Qing Empire. Mongolian tribes. Naturally the Chinese, the weaker peoples of far Western modern-day China were incorporated into the empire during the Qing expansion. Various kinds of Southern minorities. Taiwan becomes incorporated into the Chinese empire during the Qing dynasty as well. And the Jesuits helped. They managed to maintain a relationship between the mean and the Ching Dynasty with the emperor and with the court, mainly for the same reasons that they were considered useful before they helped to establish many of the things that supported empire. Whether that was again, predicting astronomical events, helping to map certain areas or producing certain kinds of machines for conquest and war effort. Paper at that sort of foreign tinkerers and inventors at the Qing Court. Now as I said, this issue of accommodating the existence of Confucianism alongside Christianity became a problem to people back in Rome. Part of the Papal sort of state. And the Jesuits, because they were growing in power and influence, had many critics in various parts of the church and various other orders of monks within the Catholic Church. And the strategy of accommodating Confucian belief was considered and pronounced by especially these critics has been heretical as being against Christian teachings. And in 1715, there was a whole debate in Rome at the Vatican, where the pope ended up siding with these critics saying that chinese rights, Confucian rights were idolatry. It was worshipping an item that was not Christian and therefore, converts in China had to give up Confucianism in order to be Christian. The emperor at this time, Emperor Kangxi was not happy with this idea. And so the bands Catholic missionary work that is going out and proselytizing, trying to convert people. Similar to what had happened a 100 years before in Japan. But he did keep many Jesuits all in court as technical advisors and jesuits kept coming to court to try and hope for the possibility of converting. The emperor at some point. And so the connection maintains between Europe and China. In through the 18th century. The Jesuits are really the kind of conduits this information back and forth still. And for an example of, of kind of one of these people met their lives was like one of these Jesuits. We might turn to a letter by a painter who was a member, a Jesuit member of the Ching court, finding Giuseppe caustic Liaoning Italian, who took a Chinese name functioning. And when he wrote back, he wrote a little bit about sort of what it was like to live in these circumstances. He wrote, Just imagine that I'm considered well rewarded just by seeing the emperor every day. And this is about all the payment I receive from my work. If you accept a few small gifts of silk or something else of little value and in which case come when we rarely. But this was not what brought me to China nor keeps me here to keep to be able to chain from one day to the next barrier there to have Sundays and feast days on which to pray to God, to paint almost nothing and keeping with one's own taste and genius, to have to put up with the 1000 other harassments, which would take too long to describe to you all this will quickly make me return to Europe. If I did not believe my brush useful for the good of religion as a means of making the emperor favorable toward the missionaries, preach it. This is the soul attraction that keeps me here as well as the other Europeans in the Emperor service. So there were Italian, they were German, there were Portuguese, there were French Catholic priests all stationed at the court and all pretty much with the same mentality. We're going to use what talents the emperor wants from us in order to hope one day that we might have the privilege of converting people to Christianity. Of course, the emperor being the prime hope of that convert. And this is a painting by Giuseppe casting Leah when he painted for the emperor of a waterfall, a pine tree and some auspicious mushrooms or fungus is as well as what Listeria here kind of climbing the pine tree and of course, the white bird of prey or hawk. All of these being auspicious classical symbols used in Chinese in painting before. But you'll notice are these differences. Now write what we might think of as a kind of heightened realism coming into the same materials. This is Incans silk, just like Chinese painters used. But now with the sort of shading and modelling of forms that we associate more with European styles of painting them with Chinese style of painting. You might compare this, for instance to the wind Jun Ming painting that we looked at rate, which is all about brushwork and calligraphic style. This is much more about precise control of the way in which the eye sees the world. Here is an image of Beijing church, Saint Joseph Church, Catholic Church, originally built in and around the time of casting. We only just before him. But that was destroyed and rebuilt several times. And this last one is in 1904 version of that Catholic church. The Catholics were allowed to have churches to practice their own religion as sort of envoys from these foreign places that helped the emperor. Out. Here is a wall-sized painting for the interior palaces. The inner court, that is, if you remember, in Beijing mirror the outer and inner courts. This is a painting that came off of the wall of one of those private spaces for the grandson of the Kangxi Emperor, man named emperor channel. In which he's had as European Jesuit painters, in collaboration with Chinese painters, paint a kind of illusionary scene in this space here, which looks like the entrance to a cave, right? All these rocks around it will be a doorway into an outer courtyard, creating the sense of actually moving into the illusion of this three-dimensionally constructed space and into the scene beyond where the emperor seen seeded with a group of ministers and two peacocks. The scene isn't just frivolous, although it looks very frivolous. There's a political metaphor happening here. These two peacocks were diplomatic gifts from Central Asian rulers. And in the poem, the inscription above the emperor at this point is talking about his recent conquest of Western China, of the area that we now call Xinjiang, to western territories. During the 18th century, there were several military campaigns to stabilize and conquer that part of China. And these gifts came back to the emperor as part of the kind of diplomatic missions involved in that conquest. And he talks about how these new officials that have come in into the empire and these new mines and peoples from the west only add to the richness of his Qing empire, his dominion. And again, this is where we begin to think of the King has this kind of conglomerate, multi-ethnic empire, where the emperors having these paintings and incorporate foreign goods in foreign ideas, both from western China. And also, if you look at the composition and the way in which the image is construction, constructed. Also coming from these European Jesuit missionaries. But their use of perspectival lines, horizon line, and shading to simulate optical realism. Here's a treatise that was also translate that from the original Latin, a book by Andrea pot, so called pictorial perspective, pictorial and architectural perspective. In which he talks about using single point perspective to construct illusion, illusionary images. And the original was written in and around the same time as Leibnitz's writing, his description of China. It's written in Latin in Italy, and then it gets translated into Chinese. Only 40 years later, in 1735. By a scholar named ENCO. There are, he also writes these translations of shear geometry, geometry textbooks that are coming from Europe as well. And they're illustrated in ways that again help Chinese painter not used to thinking of constructing and these optical terms to think about how you create the sense of a scene that you can disappear into through geometric constructions of space that again, approximate. They're not real, right? We know that their images, and that's partly because they only approximate the way in which the world is seen through a single point perspective, an horizon lines where the lines that are supposed to be parallel to one another, maybe on a building right, appear to converge, gives you a sense of depth in the image. And this is a plan. Both of our central images today, including of course, the first one. So this is an image made for the emperor with a foreign technology, copper plate and grabbing that came in with the Jesuits. With foreign modes of image-making, right? The perspectival lines acting a little bit funny in this image, right? That these all of these lines are disappearing into a kind of higher horizon point than these other lines and these other roof lines, right? Which establish horizon here rather than say up here as these lines disappear too. And their images of buildings that the Qianlong emperor, the emperor who ruled from most of the 18th century, had constructed for himself that we're an imitation of foreign styles. Now the Qianlong emperor never traveled to Europe either. These ideas of what baroque architecture from Europe looked like via the Jesuits. So the Jesuits are giving ideas not only back to people like Leibnitz and to the Catholic Church, they're also bringing different kinds of ideas in with them. Whether that's styles of painting, where styles of architecture, as seen in this image. On top of that, the person who was in charge of making these, who supervise the production of this image. Elon time was a Mongolian brought into this Cheng multi-ethnic empire in the conquest first of northern, northern territories of China. Before even the main part of China had been conquered, the Mongolians kinda came in and under Manchu control first. And so the sovereign or the, the official serving a court in this Chinese style, of course, were sometimes Muslim, sometimes Mongolian, and often up Manchu alongside their Chinese counterparts. And so this image, again is a complex layering of different affiliations that prove to the emperor his control over these kinds of visual language isn't technology is come from the west. And this image, which is not in this grouping, comes from this larger grouping of pictures of the European palaces and Waterworks. Important to note that one of the other treats that the technological know-how of the Jesuits brought where fountains, water fountains into spraying found tenants into Chinese architecture. And all of these were actual places that used to exist in what's called the Imperial pleasure palaces and gardens in the northwest quadrant of Beijing. And again, it's worth noting that fees actual places are constructed using baroque architectural European ideas coming from the Jesuits in a method. And then they're made, images are made of these actual constructions with copper plate engravings, another technology brought with the Jesuits into the court. And yet they're supervised by a Mongolian official at the Ching Dynasty Court. So we're talking about a very, again, very complicated layered set of signals happening here that are really about king emperor seeing himself as a kind of Emperor over, over overall really birth control over all of these different foreign technologies as well. And those foreign technologies included just in these palaces, hydraulic found sentences, as I said, the Baroque styles of architecture coming from Europe. Perspectival illusions like the ones you saw on that, that painting on the wall where it looks like you could walk into it except it's a flat wall right there. These Pretend illusionary visions within these palaces. And they also include a diplomatic gifts coming from France, like the tapestry is better. The other object in today's class, tapestries that were given to the emperor by the person who was then the King of France, Louis the 15th. So before we move to a comparison of those images again under kind of recap what we saw in them before. Let's move to our other text. Take a moment and remind yourself of the content of this, of this reading for today in which they hamper the same emperor who commissioned those images that we just saw, is talking about what it's like to show a foreign diplomat in the 18th century. His pleasure palaces and his attitude toward what those did for him. So how does the Qianlong emperor use these western style gardens which you saw images of actions now in the copper plate print. We appreciate complicated centered p, like emoticons happening. Mm-hm. Yeah. Right, so you guys are getting the basic core idea here of how the channel emperor is using these palaces and these fountains, not just for pleasure. He does use them for celebration, but he's using them to impress upon the various foreign diplomats that are trying to create trade deals between Europe and China to impress upon them the fact that he has a worldly person. And he got the idea all the way back in the 17 fifties. When these other envoys came from Portugal to try and pay tribute to try and create trade. He heard from them about these fountains in US and architecture. And so he just asked his pet Jesuit, caustic Leoni to create, to create these fountains. So you can imagine the Italian Jesuit having to figure out all the mathematics and hydraulics and physics. And then get together a whole team of The architects from draftsman and laborers, local and foreign, to create these things for the emperor. The emperor uses them by the 17 nineties to impress upon people like THE english ambassador or the Dutch. I bet he has everything he needs. And that if you look especially at the last line, given the size of China, there are no rarity is which we did not possess. And so he's not inclined to treat the things that these Dutch folks are bringing as tribute, as, as precious things. He says, I've got all I need. I don't need your Why is that you're bringing I don't need your inventions that you think are going to you interest me as diplomatic gifts to help you get trade. I don't need any of these things. I've got my own european palaces here. Why would I want those things? And so you're right, he's sort of showing off that he's capable of all of these kinds of languages of art, architecture, empire and control, of course, over the physical world, right? The fountains themselves. Right? And it shows this sort of luxury and prosperity of the empire to any of these Europeans who coming in thinking they have something to offer. And so again, this was a real place and we'll talk at the end of the lecture about what happened to these palaces. And they are constructed not only for the amperes pleasure, but for the display, especially to diplomatic missionaries coming from abroad, of a kind of power and control over artistic and technological languages that he's gotten. Because of the Jesuit presence. To begin with. The Jesuits are bringing these styles and allowing the Emperor to create these sort of fictional European spaces in Beijing. Now the other object we have does a very similar thing, except for the opposite side of the equation, as many of you said. This image, which is also a palaces, is ostensibly about China as well. And image of China is constructed in a much more colorful way. It's a little bit more disorderly in the sense that you get this market scene with all these sort of good spilling over and everywhere. There are these lush tropical plants as if this is South Asia somewhere. But it's constructed again around human interactions as time. But within the same kinds of architectural spaces. Sort of Chinese-style roofs, particularly conveying to European audiences as time if this is China. So this was originally made, as the label says, in the late 18th century, in the 17 sixties. For the European Court, for the French court of Louis the 15th. It took several people to design it. It was originally done after a painting by the famous painter Francois Boucher. But Van designed into a tapestry at the Beauvais royal tapestry factory outside. Parents and obey its wall and woven silken. It's meant to hang on a wall as a kind of illusionary space, right? That's sort of an extension of the interior space into some fictional outside worlds. And so the figures are about the same size as people. Horizon line would stand Similar to a person looking on it. And you would sort of imagine and project yourself into this fantasy space. There was very much a fantasy space for Louis the 15th of what China was like. Again, based off of information that he was getting from various Jesuits. What's sort of doubly curious about this object is that a set of these Chinese tapestries and so-called Chinese tapestries. And there's more than just this one that our European imaginations of what China's like or actually sent as diplomatic gifts to Louis at t2, the Qianlong emperor, the same person commission those palaces. And they were kept in the European palaces as European ornaments that imagined China in a building. Imagine a Europe that was located in China. It gets very tricky in a way to think about all the different layers of imagination happening here and of fantasy. And of what we call shin was R0 at this point in European arts and culture. Because the contact that existed between Asia and the West, beginning where these traders coming around the Cape of Good Hope and establishing connections. And then we follow the Jesuits as well. Created a hunger for all things Asian. It was information coming from the Jesuits are actual objects like tea, like porcelain, et cetera. And we talked about this when we thought about porcelain as well. These rare, glittering, expensive luxury items that from foreign lands that were prized in part because they weren't completely understood, right? And it led to a kind of exoticism of all things Chinese. So that European artists like Boucher who painted this image or what helps us name paleo, who was a famous row cocoa interior designer, creates, created for European, the wealthy Europeans. There's little fantasies about what China looked like, right? With his rock gardens and pagodas. Confusing and overlapping all sorts of ideas that were not actually Chinese but which suited a kind of european interest in China. Where you have women more or less than European garb and with European faces dressed up. I'll hashing watts or in a Chinese way. And we call this exoticism and this fad throughout the decorative arts in Europe. Cen wasn't, it's a French word for Chineseness essentially. And it really takes root in, within fee arts moment that we call row coco. Which involve these really lights, florid, kind of organic forms like you see in this image that don't seem to actually kind of respond to gravity. And the, and the images were there included. That are about this sort of light, airy lines and decorative motifs, often vegetarian and organic and mixed in with those half the time. Word, gestures at all or imaginations of what it meant to be. Chinese. As an example, here is an early 18th century installation, so-called Chinese room or porcelain cabinet at the charlatan bird castle in Berlin. And you can see that these various blue and white porcelain, which have originally were made for use as a plate, as a place to put things on a plate or you certain things on the larger plates where he's earns might have been used to contain barriers and dried flowers or t's, et cetera. You can't use any of these plates. They are purely decorative surface that cake the walls. It is otherwise neoclassical fixtures, right? You can see the sort of illusionary roof happening here with his bowels strand is little cherubs. You can see these classical columns but set into is it'll painted panels. Our so-called Chinese ladies. And in all of his recesses you get these plates, but you're just being used for decorative purposes. So the madness was on, was intense. And just to remind you, all of these ideas are coming from, adjusts it where it's at this point and through traded objects and traded goods coming in with the China trade. And so that sense of China's being this aloof, exotic place, but it's also philosophically advanced. Paul's, it's China really has a kind of Equal to Europe in a way that eventually disintegrates in the 19th century. But at this point, China was thought of as an empire on equal standing and footing with any European empire. And so again, when we consider this tapestry image, which is a kind of object made for European interiors with stone walls and cold climates, Right? And it's an illusionary space that, that allows Europeans to project themselves into these facts, these about China that are got from records and letters back to Europe about what life was like in China, these letters that have biases to them. And then the hubris imagine of, of Louis the 15th sending this tapestry to the emperor and saying this is basically how we imagine your life to be he. But there's very little that's Chinese buffets to Chinese audience. One wonders whether Chen Long upon receiving this textile, would have even recognized himself in it, in the architectural or in these sorts of caricatures of Chinese officials and merchants that are being shown. We might draw parallel back to our Montagnier painting, right? Where porcelain was this highly desired could in the early modern world, in Europe because it couldn't be manufactured there. And you see these merchants also handling these plume might larger blue and white porcelain objects in this imagined scene with little elephant in the background and a camel here. In a way that is echoing this earlier fascination that we looked at circa 1500 in Italy. We might think about images of the emperor. And this is a formal portrait of the emperor Chen low. And here within the tapestry, part of what we're getting is an imagination of what the emperor or king or perhaps the local magistrate in this area would have looked like sitting on a so-called thrown over this marketplace with a giant teapot in front of them. This is all fancy. This is all made up. But it's built off of ideas drawn from goods that are being traded from Europe and from Jesuit ideas. You would've had to imagine though, that despite even kind of insulting, Had the Emperor of China really thought about the ways in which the King of France magic Tim. And in these images we actually see the King of France, Louis the 15th and the Qianlong emperor as they wanted to be seen as a both Imperial portraits from around the same time. You see there's only a 15-year difference between the two, showing both as relatively young rulers and their respective languages. Vampire, Louis here isn't his finest gold and earn mining silks with a giant sort of billowing validate or silk backdrop and a neoclassical palace environment. In this, I'm probably embroidered gold embroidered piece up either for or against silk or velvet with his thirdly pattern audit holding his staff and his crown. And here you have the Chen Long Emperor seated on an imperial throne with golden dragons. With, as we notice, hard perspectival lines and hard symmetry like our print right? Where all of these seem to focus our attention on the body of the emperor himself. And this image was painted by one of the Italian Jesuits, Leoni, especially the facial features which give a sense of the realness of the body sitting in it. And these two probably saw each other very much as equal as not only something we're grabbing from Leibnitz's sort of fantasies of an earlier, suddenly earlier moment. But if you look at their track records there, both the patriarchs of these, right at this point, well established royal family is ruling over vast empires. Whereas the Qianlong emperor has expanded the Chinese empire to be the largest is in Chinese history. Louis the 15th, however, is beginning to lose his empire. As nationalism ticks. Arise in Europe and as various colonies declare independence. But just to compare these two Who are in many ways swapping these gifts of these tapestries and other things. Cello was the fourth emperor of this Chin Dynasty, this last Dynasty, this of ruled by people of Manchu descent from the north and who again synthesize or take on this kind of Chinese qualities merge rule over the empire. He really saw himself as modeled after his grandfather, the Emperor Kangxi, who was the person who stabilize the Qing Empire after the first emperor chain died, not long after the conquest was complete. And these two were some of the longest lived and most successful in terms of stabilizing their empires. Emperors in Chinese history. And as I said before, under the Emperor Cheng, large swaths of territory is of China became part of the empire that had never been a full part of the empire before. And part of this is grounded on this sort of Multi-Ethnic Identity of Mencius, Mongolians, we, Igor's Han Chinese, various Southern minorities, et cetera. I'll being brought in as part of this new empire. The population swells to over 275 million people, but land increases as well to help support those people. Start really until the 19th century that things start to fall apart. We're population and swells too much for the amount of arable or farmable land that exists. And channel. Not only enjoyed this kind of a swell in expansive empire and in the richness of the empire. He's also benefiting from FAD for all things Chinese in Europe, where money is being spent to get these luxury goods from china. And that leads to extra wealth from the China trade, especially in the 18th century. As China trade falls off in the late 18th and beginning of the 19th century. That's when the decline of the Chinese empire begins to set in. And not only the pressures from, from that, but also the pressures of the over expanded empire that the Qianlong emperor house has created. One of the sort of efforts at proving his commitment to Chinese-style history was to create an encyclopedic collection of all of Chinese literature and history called the Seq2 trade issue. The Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, which had never been done before on the parallel. Louis the 15th, or rules more or less for the same amount of time. Is also somebody who models himself after a grandfather or great-grandfather figure of Louis the 14th and so-called Sun King. And he is the son of a dynasty that rules for a somewhat parallel period in France and really saw himself as anointed by God. Over this empire of France that consisted of colonies abroad in the Americas and within Europe. But Louis the 15th loses some of those territory is rather than channel expands them. But all of this again, is to draw a parallel between these two rulers who are exchanging these sorts of gifts with one another on equal terms. Gifts like this, which is another print made in Europe. After paintings originally painted for the Emperor in China by the Jesuits that glorified the conquests. If the Qianlong emperor had made of Western China, especially sort of the Mongolian and Western bigger areas. And just think about that diplomatically. You have a king half a world away. Who helps to print for you these copper plate engravings that celebrate your military victories over areas of domination over kind of colonies you could say of, of China. Again, pointing to a kind of equality of terms of polymers. These two emperors and empires really saw one another until the end of the 18th century. Just as a little segue into that, if you want to stay with me for a minute or two more. This is what happened to the imperial palaces in Beijing when that sense of inequality of empires disintegrated with the rise of nationalism in the 19th century. In order to create equal trade. Because many European nations were sort of faltering end of the trade arrangement which made China's originally 18th century. Several wars were fought. The Opium Wars, as they're called, in which European armies invaded and looted and burned these exact palaces that the emperor had created to emulate european palaces only a 100 years before. And one of the salient features of this particular print, my chose it as that the figure of these Chinese zodiac figures, right? Any of you have been to a Chinese restaurant, know that a 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac is signified by these sort of animal figures. Here. They're created for these European palaces by Jesuits in Beijing. This group of sculptures with these animals, zodiac heads and these scholars or men's bodies in robes ALL around this sort of fountain made for them for when the looting happened in the 19th century when these armies invaded, many things were stolen, destroyed, and these palaces and many things were taken back to Europe, including some of the heads of these sculptures, which were cast in bronze for the emperor in the 18th century by the Jesuits. And then became a major factor in 2008, when two of them came on the market. In Europe, they've been in the collection of Louis Vuitton, his partner and re bearish air. And they were sold to a Chinese bitter originally for $80 million or something like is an astronomical price. But as a political gesture that better refused to pay. He said you took these things in the 19th century from China and they don't belong to you. It created quite a complicated set of issues for the auction house. Eventually gifted them to the Chinese state, anterior to the poly auction house museum to go with two others that existed there as a means of a kind of repatriation. But only as a result of a lot of pressure. And I way, way contemporary Chinese artist has created a series of these heads on stakes to imagine some of the ones that don't exist anymore. And to really ask ourselves what these objects are and where they come from. Are they Chinese or the Europeans made for the foreign rulers of the Manchu Ching dynasty. Whereas this sort of ownership of this and where's their origin? That's partly what his installation asks. So that's the end of today's class. I've got a few minutes over. Thank you for staying with me and I'll see you next class, which is our last class of this section. And I hope you'll have a nice afternoon. Thanks. Thank you.


## [17. Art for the Middle Classes](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/17-art-for-the-middle-classes?module_item_id=2446635)
 All right, it is class I'm so we'll start more or less on time and whoever needs to trickle in, trickle in. First of all, for reminder, which I've been putting out there the last couple of classes. Your second essay, your last essay is due today, says before class. But if you look closely, the actual deadline, deadline, deadline is the end of the day today. So get that in so that you get full credit for that. Again, follow the rubric I think by the interconnectivity of the ideas that it forms an actual essay instead of just blindly following the rubric and you go to, Well, any questions about that before we start class? K, seeing no questions, let's start with our reading for today. There's too much reading for me to put it all on one screen. So you're gonna have to open up the reading to remind yourself of the content. And in that reading, an excerpt from introduction in the first chapter of tales of the floating world, written in 1666 in Japan, I want you to think about a couple of major themes and then try and pull a couple of quotes that exemplify those themes. What does this text seemed to be about in general? And where's your evidence for that? Mm-hm. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, great. So far you guys are going to be a lot of good input from the introduction section, but go also to the Book One section to get a few responses from there. I think Ryan map, Dan Ethan Eric DNA. You've done a great job about that first part. Some of you also move on to the second part. Oh, we'll start with the first part. Some of you have been reading in coming up with ideas about that first book. Then we can bring that in later. But let's move to the introductory at first. And a lot of you talked about the fact that the introduction seems to be a machine. You are encouraging you to live your life, right? To make the most of it as Matt and rain started us off and has banned Indiana. And Erica said that pheno shredding according to this introduction or worrying about what you can control, just makes you unhappy, gives you indigestion as, as it says. And so the sort of initial sort of introduction really telling us to make the most of what we have and to take pleasure in the world, right? And it's that pleasurable aspect that is really the focus of the book, the different pleasures of, of the world. And the title of this tax tales from the floating world is a pun. That is the word in Japanese, operates in two different registers of meaning. It originally is a Buddhist term for a world full of sorrows, right? Remember how we talked about Buddhism as identifying attachments to the world and desires as the main things that cause us to be upset, anxious to go to war, et cetera, are various perceived needs and sort of detach yourself from those needs. The needs of the world full of sorrows is a Buddhist concept. But in Japanese, the same spoken word, different characters, different writing, the same sounds. 2k. Yo means the floating world, the world of pleasures. That is. And the introduction here is making a kind of play off of that just as you all know, correctly identified. There's this. The issue of what do you do, all your worries? Well, you just let them go and take pleasure in the world is about this early texts, or at the beginning of this text, the prefaces is telling us. And it starts off with a little poem, right? Such a strange thing, my heart is my own, but it won't do as i want it. When nothing goes as you want it to. It's a sorrowful world. And this poem points exactly at this idea of attachment, desire, right? Which if you have a Buddhist perspective, right, that's that last line. The sorrow for world is something that you have to learn to overcome to detach yourself from i in order to live well in the world and to move on in terms of Buddhist terms toward enlightenment. But the rest of the text after this goes on to say that this idea of detaching ourselves is not the way to go about it at all. It continues, it seems that they call this a sorrowful world, right, book you, there's the pun again, because in all things nothing can be fulfilled. You feel a niche but you can't scratch it. So you have desires that are satiable. It seems within reach, but you can't reach it. In this world, there's not one thing that goes as one desires to. That's precisely why it is called a sorrow for world. So that seems to be an explication of the poem read. This is why we get anxiety, upsets. Philip displeasure, right? Can't get what we want. Simple, basic desires, sometimes more complicated desires. But then there's a transition that happens in the second paragraph and it says, No, no, the world's not full of sorrows. And that's not the meaning of it at all. When we live in this world, we see and we hear the good and bad things, everything is interesting. We can't see more than one inch in front of us. That is, who can know what the future we'll bring. And this is what many of you focus on, like Matt Ryan, bandana, Erik Hall talking about living in the moment, right? So rather than being obsessed with the things that give you sorrow and trying to overcome her sorrow. This taxes admonishing you or encouraging you that is to embrace it. And it goes on to say, when we live in this world, we hear the good, the bad and all things and everything is interesting. You can see more than one inch in front of us and just fretting about it just causes us indigestion and I'm an upset stomach that you get for worrying, right? So you cross that bridge as you come to it, you gaze at the moon, the snow, the cherry blossoms in the bright Autumn. Leaves. Recite poems, drink saccade, and make merry, not even poverty. It will be a bother if you do this right, floating along with an unsinkable disposition. Like a cork to typo, sorry, cork bobbing along with the current. And this is what we call the floating world. So embrace your pleasures is what this introductory text is about. And the second part, the chapters gone to elaborate on what happens when you embrace these pleasures rather than trying to overcome them from kind of Buddhist perspective. Let's see if I've caught up on any kind of. Just catching up on the chat window here. Read so many. Daria I see discussing the CON, text of utero, as well as Zach and Lydia and diarrhea, right? He's not necessarily weighed down by the sorrows of life. He's going out to seek his pleasure. But there are certain consequences to that. And this book is giving us a kind of description of what it's like to go into the pleasure districts, the capital of Edo. And so Episode six of book one is call the title diff regarding advice against when Ching. It's a rough translation, but what that means and even refer translation would be whoring. But really within the context of the pleasure districts of 80, it's about going to visit courtesans, which as I've discussed in an earlier lecture, is really not necessarily about sex so much as it's about pleasurable entertainment, which can include music, drinking, and talking, more so than any sort of sexual activity. But the description of how theatre has to kind of sneak off to the pleasure districts in order to take his pleasure. There. Gives us also a sense of shame, right? Or at least of uterus shame that he's hiding what it is that he's doing because it might be judged by the rest of his family. So this section begins with that trait that's introduced in the preface to the story as well. Once upon a time, a hitherto unknown, HE attacked your thorough and he began frequenting the pleasure houses of the Shimomura quarter. This is an actual place that the tail is fiction, alright? But the Shimomura quarter was where many of the houses for courtesans existed in his time in the capital of EDO. And here's where the deception happens, right? He says he will leave home looking for all the world. Like he was going out on some respectable business. I'm just gonna go to the bank or whatever. But on route, he would Hale crossroads sedan chair, and ride along South along Umea street. It's an actual street in Tokyo. And you would follow the TBA Highway up to the entrance of Shema Barra. Then he would send back the power, that is the Chair, putting on a large woven read hat who'd walked quickly over what was called slipping up grounds and rumor Lane and soon arrive at as ignition house street, climbing on the second floor of one of the houses. He would meet with a course on. He had known for a long time. So he's doing this sneakily. He's going out of the house pretending like he's just Garden Street to go get groceries or go to the bank or whatever, something respectable. But then after he's walked away as he catches a sedan chair going in the other direction. That brings him to all of these pleasurable streets. And again, these are actual streets at the moment in 17th century, Ada, which is modern day Tokyo. If you're following along with this, you're basically getting, has the reader a set of directions on how to get to the pleasure district. So what happens in the pleasure district? He meets with his quarters on that he has an ongoing relationship with. And here's where his edge right in supposedly fulfilled. But as the text tells us, not all is all is well in this relationship. Because under say, not infrequently, they would engage in Lovers quarrels. But he knew better than to take the girls repurchase seriously. Any laughter? I all thoughts of ever being able to please her entirely. At other times, being promised her true love until the end of time, a beam so intoxicated with joy so as to think less of his own life than dirge. And all the while he was being found on and flattered by the higher jesters against as part of the kind of experience of going to the cortisone to the very end of his nose and his boastful face in this way, he visited the pleasure quarter every day, and then he used up the gold and silver as one would use water, spending everything his father had so carefully saved. So there's a couple of things going on here. The courtesan who is there to provide, provide pleasure is providing it in a variety of ways, right? Including corals making one feel like the logos loss only to regain it again and to be overjoyed at that sense. And uterus passions are kind of oscillating back and forth to sometimes he feels like this is just a frivolous thing. And I know I'm not supposed to be in love with this person because she's paid to give me the impression that she's in love with me. And at the same time, when he's there, at other moments, he does feel truly in love with her and would do anything for her to the point that at the end of this section has used up all the money. That is parents who saved for him. He's become sort of a waste role. He's become up a protocol, some sort of contender here. And so the text is complicated in the sense that the story that it gives you the reader in the 17th century in Japan, who directs you on how to get to the pleasure districts. And then there's also certain showing you the good sides and bad sides of taking the pleasure of this kind of company. They've chosen this particular print because it shows exactly that sort of sneakiness that utero, Thanks, getting away with it. This guy here in the center of the scene with a straw hat. Where who's facing these ladies here? Let's draw hah hides who he thinks that hides who he is. But if you're attuned to other aspects of dress, you know that this is a highly born person because they're carrying to sort something that you could only do if you are a son of certain rank within a well-known family. Notice that the other people are here to entertain, to fawn over him, hear music is being played within one of the spaces of one of the core design houses. And so our figure here is carefully camouflaged, but not so carefully that we can't identify him as someone who's relatively well-to-do, going to take pleasures just like Kyoto did. And so our preface was talking about going and taking advantage of the pleasures of life because you never know what life is going to bring. So why get caught up in overcoming your sorrows? But then our story talks about utero taking those pleasures in bananas in a sneaky way, and then spending all of his money wrapped up in this sort of fiction about love that the courtesan is bringing to him. Here's another section from that same chapter on advice against quenching. That goes into describing some other kinds of pleasure at the pleasures or dressing up. And this is describing hetero still. He said his coat wasn't the latest style with the ham pulled high and as wide sash tied and back in a fine scattered. He carried a short sword with a glittering gold sword guard, the stocking he stockings, he were elegant with foreign style buttons attached. And as he collect alone on his high wooden clogs. Taking a better look, we see the socle yucky style of his qua fewer, shaved all the way down to the IRS. The sideburns thinned and his mustache trimmed in his own little special way. On his head. He were great, woven read hat, pulled low over his eyes. Can we call as the parents good or bad? Certainly it was little more from the epitome of Crete style, the man servants of lesser samurai. So our speaker here, our narrator who's giving us an insight into what Kyoto is doing, is throwing a little bit of shade here at the end, after describing all of the ways in which thinks that he's dressed himself up in these latest styles, right? He's being fashionable for the moment in 1660 sets with hair cuts that are done in very particular ways with shaved shaped up the sides, with the sideburns thinned out and a very particular kind of mustache that again, gave utero a sense of being different from the other people around, right? This's fashion circa 1666 in Japan. And yet the narrator takes a little aside as he's giving you the view of your thorough and basically saying, look, theaters dressed himself up in this way. But it's a little tacky. This is a crude style that lesser samurai, that is relatively low ranking, high-ranking people, the servants of those people. This is how, how they dress. And so he's casting aspersions or judgments on your Jerome. And in this print here you get a sense for the attention in some of the woodblock prints made the same time to those particular features of style. Whether it's the particular way in which someone's robes are draped over them, are wrapped around them. The hairstyles, especially look at the hairstyle. This woman with this large sort of done out the back. These extra hair implements to style in a certain raised way. And the same can be true of the men in this picture. This particular image is interesting in part because it is a fictional description and that is an image of a real life event and a really juicy one. The story goes that in the late 17th century, around the same time that this book was written. Notice the images from a later point when kind of myth of the story had already grown to the point that it was, it was legendary. There were these two lovers AS son of a, of a kind of lesser family. And his courtesan, Lebur, the son who's shown here. Should I go and patching, murders somebody in a city in the western part of Japan. And rather than face the consequences, he runs away to Tokyo to aid over capital I and tries to hide out there. He's caught, he's executed in 1679. This is, these are real events. And his lover travels to his grave in order to commit suicide at his grab as well. So this is a star-crossed lovers kind of scenario. Not unlike Romeo and Juliet. Style of story. And images like this were shown in the woodblock prints made at the same time as these sorts of descriptions of this pleasure district in Japan. Here's another section, and this is the last section I think I have excerpted to kind of to explain or give more depth to what prints like the ones we're looking at. Both illustrated and then reinforced for their, for their viewers. Again, this is from the same section, book one, episode six regarding advice against quenching. We're still talking about friend Hillsborough here. And this is where some of the other judgment gets cast on him. His brothers and relatives pained by his behavior, cautioned him in the following manner of late we hearing that you've been frequenting such a totally unbelievable place as the Shimomura says, really not the proper thing to do. By her nature. A courtesan is quite alluring for this reason, it's readily understandable that a man's heart should be conquered and that he should fall head over heels in love for charming. So we're starting off here saying, judging, right, we're getting the voice of his brothers and sisters saying, look, you just spent all the dad's money going off to the to the pleasure districts. What the hell you're doing. This is improper, right? But then the next section that follows is an extended description of all of that pleasure. So there's a kind of contradiction happening here of both the moral judgments and the indulging of the reader in a somewhat lush description of what those pleasures are that the reader slash shelter or should not be having. Her charming when Louis tresses her face lovely as a cherry blossom her eyebrows with the mascara calling a deep green tree tops of the distant mountains. Laughing crimson lips like the first opening up the high viscous petals. Policy, tease her polished teeth. White just as the driving snow. Arms and legs slim, not at all differing in beauty from the Chinese Diane, just beginning to blue and hedge, her lips languorous like a loose wound spool. The fragrance of a perfume reaching to the skies and how lovely when she moods swing back and forth, truly should be easily mistaken for the living incarnation of the Amira buddha. When compared to this creature, a man's wife can hardly seen more than a salted fish long past its prime. So that's too many men go to that ruin. So there's, there's, there's humor here and there's a conscious self-contradiction happening on behalf of these voices within the story. Admonishing here too, for being a bad boy. But then admitting secretly that all of these desires they have as well. But all of these beautiful metaphors that describe how attractive a courtesan can be in natural metaphors for the most part. And then even a kind of sack religious, Buddhist reference rate that these courtesans are almost like the living incarnation of Almeida buddha himself. And so again, another reference to Buddhism, which is a kind of undercurrent of metaphors and ideas that constantly happen in Japanese literature and thought here being used somewhat, again, sort of sacrilegious sleigh. And then followed of course with his comments about salted fish. So this text, again is both giving us a little bit of guilt and also indulging us in the pleasures of the quarter district, of the pleasure district, in its tails of the floating world. And in this image from the 18th century, you get a sense for the different characters of different kinds of courtesans. Here you have the three types of drunken cortisone, according to the printmaker, who tomato that you have angry, we'd be in giggly, sort of like the seven dwarves. And anyway, what's that one called? Sleeping Beauty? Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, right? But again, depending on your inclinations as a patron of a courtesan, you might like somebody who's angry when they're drunk or somebody begins to cry, maybe you want to be the limit comforts that person or someone who gets just abuela giggly, right? And so our tails and our images are giving us little insights into all of the kinds of things you can do with your money if you have extra money, right? And that's the key to this. The pleasure district is for those who have money to spare. And the pleasure decision really does explode in the capital of Edo, Tokyo. During that took Ogallala Shogun at where the capital is located there. And this is again the last Shogun it, of the Japanese historical period. We mentioned this when we talked about Japan in relationship to Europe as well. And you'll remember that this last Shogun acts the tuple gala Shogun, it has an isolationist foreign policy due to the, well, due to the law set down by toggle go at ASU. And also due to the sense that foreign religions were causing a certain amount of strife within Japan. And so these tails that we're getting, these prints that we're getting are very internally focused on the culture developing and Japan at this point in which you have a relatively stable empire. Not at war during this time, at least with outside forces. And this leads to increasing urbanization. Innovations in agriculture create a more broadly dispersed population in terms of what their occupations are. And you get an increased group of people with extra money to spare and extra time with which to spend that what we tend to think of as the middle classes. And so these entertainments, these pleasures are really directed toward those kinds of people. And in the prints that are produced in the capital and throughout Japan at this time. What you're mostly seeing are the kinds of entertainment culture that is directed toward those middle classes. You get sometimes domestic scenes, right? A kind of blissful interior of a home with a happy husband, wife and kids and maybe a little cat in the corner as well, right? You also get scenes and protozoans like we've just discussed. You get real life dramas such as the murder suicide story I told you just a few slides ago. And you also get a lot of the other kinds of entertainment, images of a lot of the other kinds of entertainment, such as Sumo wrestling, various kinds of plays, whether it's no theatre or Kabuki theatre. And you get at this point celebrities as well, actors known for doing particular parts in these plays. And there are whole prints devoted to the celebrity actors. If you look at this scene here, you can see some of the sense of the kind of bustling social atmosphere of these urban spectacles in the capital. We had the musicians in the background and the play happening in the foreground. But the print really shows you everything else that might be happening. You have this guy crawling up over the boundary between these two box seats in order to go pick a fight with these guys over here. You'd have courtesans moving between some of the boxes. You get u in these prints indulge in all of the various kinds of activity that might be happening. Up in the cheap seats, the box seats, people are shoving each other out of the way. And here in the background you're getting different kinds of props that are about to be brought into the play. Now, if we step back and remember fat, technically sort of how these prints come about. We can remember that we first stock talked about woodblock printing back with the Tripitaka Korean. Or I'm going to give you a brief history in that lesson of how woodblock print texts develop largely with the expansion of Buddhism. Remember this image, our first illustrated book in World History found in a cave at dune Hall and meant to help spread ideas about Buddhism. Then we talked about, and then we talked about the ways in which different sutras were reproduced throughout Korea, Japan, and China. To help spread. I'm proselytize in Buddhism in order to gain merit. But printing didn't stay, particularly within the religious sphere and there's no reason why it should of and illustrated books were quite common. At least. Books with sort of frontes, illustrations, you might get one image and then the texts would follow. From this in a moment. In the late Tang Dynasty onward, eventually, multicolored printing develops. So not just the basic line and negative space, white and black. By the 17th century. Very advanced woodblock, multicolored or poly chromatic woodblock printing has been developed in China and from there, it spreads as a, as a technique throughout the rest of East Asia, particularly in Japan, to show the various kinds of pleasure district events that we just talked about. And here's an image of the some of the earliest relatively high quality multicolored will woodblock prints that are being made in China. And you can see that with these prints you're getting 123456, sometimes seven or eight different colors and gradients of color, which with wood blocks is actually quite hard to reproduce. This is an example of an early 20th century woodblock print maker using polychrome wood block technique. And depending on your image and how many colors you wanted any image, you might have 510, even 15 different sections of woodblock used on the same piece of paper to build up your image. And you can manipulate that image as this one here where you have two boats on the water, shown, depending on how it's printed with different colors and different blocks at various points in the day, evening and even the deep at night. And so just to give you an idea of how this is done, I'm going to show a little video, video turn on hormone. So I believe you should be able to, in a moment, we'd get my act together from one. Should be able to see this video now, can't just get a bump that you can see the YouTube channel. Okay, great, thanks. Well screen. Pick the music is pretty terrible, so I'm going to reduce a tremendous hit play here. It's only a few minutes long. Let me skip ahead. Are actually getting to the point. So one thing that you'll be able to see is that there's more than one block here that this poly chromatic woodblock technique requires. This is the first image and you'll see that the first part of the image, and you'll see that the first thing that this pin maker does is take the paper and align it to a couple of corner positions. A little right angle notches at the corner of each plate that allow you to know where the paper stands in relationship to where you can see the little red angle in relationship to which tone you're adding. So the first thing is printed as a kind of medium, gray to black tone. As you can tell, this is where he's about to add the red on that same piece of paper to the image. And it's in these three particular places who takes the same piece of paper, lines it up to the corner again. And on top of the gray and black that he's just added, he rubs in the red. And again, it's not like normal printing in our minds, right? There's not just a straight through process of printing it out. It takes a lot of manual technique, Alignment and subtlety in order to get things to properly registers that you read in the right place and relationship to your black. Here what he's done is he's working with, with the enzyme, apply the sort of water-based pigment to it. Again, these line up the paper again. And then the yellow is coming in on the hair pieces around the fan. This is another tone of yellow on a completely different block. You'll notice that this is the third block, fourth block that we've seen so far. And there's two different color sets on this block. To sometimes blocks can be used for different details. The first detail is going to add in yellow is a texturing. The robes that black, red, yellow, and then a gold texturing on top of all of that. And the order has to be precise to it because if you end up putting black on top of yellow, if muted your yellow. So here's the image so far, partway built with four blocks that we've seen so far. And again, you'll see for economy sick, sometimes the same block is used with different colors if you can isolate properly which of those colors go in which section? So we lined this up at a different starting point right there in this block because they're different. Color is being used. There are different notches as well, and you put the corner two different notch in order to get a different tone, these deep red tones at the corners of the lapel of her textile. And again, the order of this all has to be precisely down in order to get the right effect at the end of these different layered colors coming together to give a sense of a body in space and proper kind of shading. And of course to be alluring and entertaining. And see how far we keep moving here. So as you can see that keeps getting built up section by section, block-by-block. I think there are ten different blocks in this particular image of a courtesan with a fan, with calligraphy on it or with a pattern on it. We can see it each time rate. And again, the order has to be precisely laid out so that everything is aligned properly and built up in the correct fashion. See here, he goes in with a little rag and wipes the part that he's just done in ink to give a gradient, right? So there's a certain amount of manual know-how that has to be done here as well. And you remember that her hair is already established when a dark and a dark kind of gray tone. And this hides the extra rich layer of black. And so wiping away that edge that he's just blocked up will give a sense of gradient in the hair. Right here of the darker hair moving into a kind of lighter hair as the sculpt becomes visible at the brow line. And lastly, because it makes sense to put this in, lasts in case you fudge anything at the borders and boundaries. Now comes the background colour, a kind of deep orangey yellow. And you can see that left in reserve to carve the ways, the earnings area, the area where all of this hard work he's put into building up the image does not take on any of this new color that he's just add it, it just goes into the background. He salts the whole thing in order to dry it. And then brushes off that that salt. And the very last thing he adds is the inscription in the corner. As you see in this blocked kind of cartouche with the label on it than all, fool white ladies clap for him, and the video is done. We'll go back to the PowerPoint. Whoops, sorry about that. Alright. So again, the image that we're looking at today is built up in exactly that manner and is meant to serve the same clientele that we've just talked about that would just be read about in the tails of the floating world. This first image. And this is an image that is probably very familiar to many of you. It's become iconic, is probably the most well-known Japanese print in Europe in world history. And it's often known as The Great Wave. Its official title is the under the wave off of Kanazawa. And that's written over. Let's see. I guess it's set up near No, this is the 36 views of eta. So the official title for this particular piece is under the way of off of Kanazawa. And you see a set or Isman in the front in these three boats, one hidden behind this wave, trying to make it through. This relatively Rush was relatively active ocean, right? With these waves pulling into giant swells and forming white caps, which the frothy water comes up over the top of the wave when it crashes down on these poor guys who are just holding on trying not to get capsized in these boats. And in the background framed by this giant tumultuous natural event is Mount Fuji, volcanic mountain, not too far from the capital of EDO. And if you look at this print, and again, we're asking ourselves how is this done? Try and count off the number of blocks that it must have taken to produce this image. In the way you can do that is by thinking about each of the different tones or colors, right? So just if you look at the blue is alone, you have this light blue. It's medium blue. Dark blue color. Here. You have the dark blue color moving into the sections of these guys in terms of their robes as well. We have a kind of a light brown for the wood of the boats and then an off-white color for the other part of the boats. In the background, that same light brown is used him as perhaps touched up with a little bit of a fade. You'd have a hard black line over the edge and the rage of these waves. And for each of these little curling. Fingers of the, of the white caps. And then, and this is the hardest thing to, to produce, right? You have the negative space left by all of this froth that's coming off of the way of all of that is left is negative blank paper just like the top part. And so when you're constructing the image, even though you're building up this image of a wave, you have to leave these negative spaces were nothing zinc in order to get that sense of the frothy wave. As we saw, the inscription was probably done last with the separate I'm inking or wood block. And then you get this dark gray gradient on the horizon as well. Again, probably smudged to get that sense of fade. So we're talking at least a half dozen different blocks to produce this one iconic image. This has made it a slightly later date than the texts that we're talking about. At a date when the government had to some degree wanted to curtail some of the more illicit behavior happening in the pleasure district. Some of the more pleasurable things probably happening in the pleasure district. And part of that was achieved through a kind of censorship of woodblock prints. Point you get woodblock prints moving toward other subject matter, whether it is plays or natural phenomenon like this great wave or the mountain Mount Fuji. And if you look closely at this description that I've given you the label for this. This comes from a larger series. It's not just a print that was meant to stand alone singularly, there were 36 different prints that prints, they all gave you a view of Mount Fuji. And each of them is constructed with again, a different complete set of wood blocks. And by creating the set of 36 different views, different prints, you create a kind of collectors album ramp. The ad, the advocate or the efficient auto. The client, right? Who wants to buy the set of prints, wants to get all 36 of these views, each of which at some level contains Mount Fuji. Even though different kinds of activities are shown right here of Mount Fuji viewed from the rice fields of a worry province. And you can just barely see it in the background where these rice fields use perspectival lines and the barrel itself to dry all the way out to the thing that's happening in the foreground. Where you have this labor are trying to pull together this giant barrel. Here you have a little hitching post for horses along the road that's traveled on the outer parts of the capital. Again, food, you just step barely in the background there. And here you have fishermen who got a close up of Mount Fuji with some of the volcanic action being shown in the foreground. And then of course, our famous wave picture. And many of the prints at this time were produced in series. And of course, this is a marketing tool for. People interested in these images, you buy one on a pile 36. Beyond that, these prints, also, because there are 36 views of Mount Fuji reflect another aspect of middle-class culture, which is tourism. Again, people who had moved into the kind of merchant middle-class often had extra time and money to spend. And one of the things you do with it other than going to a play, going to assume a match, or maybe going and visiting courtesan would be to go traveling even if just locally. So here is a map of the various famous places along this major highway or road called the torpedo. As seen from a narrow perspective or in one view. And you can see Mount Fuji over here on the horizon. I believe this is Kyoto and the background aren't. Yeah, I think this is Kyoto in the background. And then labelled along these rows are all the various sites and the various sort of famous towns along the road. And there will be illustrated in these multiple saturates at 36 views of Mount Fuji is different views of Mount Fuji from various places on a tourist circuit that people would actually travel on the weekends or on in their free time around the Capitol. Here are various places on the road as labeled in the horizon in their town names, hada, Can I and Zeki. And so tourism is another aspect of what we're thinking about through our print great wave off of Kanazawa, One of the seaside towns nearby, the capital from which you could still see Mount Fuji. And so you might know this prints and think of it purely in terms of the wave. And if you look closely at it, you see Mount Fuji in the background. But it's part of a larger spectrum of images meant for entertainment and meant to document the pleasures of having extra time and money to spend in the capital in 80, you get serially produced polychrome woodblock prints, right? Like the 36 views of Mount Fuji. Sometimes it was a 100 flowers each in different seasons. Sometimes it would be historical figures or events. Our legendary poets, the six poetic immortals, all produced one set for you to collect. And this produces a relatively inexpensive visual culture that was designed around the tastes and desires. These urban middle class, not the highest elite, but not somebody who's out in the field all day working from dawn, dusk either. And the images were designed to entertain. They're designed around sometimes highly dramatic real life stories, events affect them. In a murder, suicide of this couple. In the upper-left corner. They were designed around the kind of fun activities and ideas that would help or interactions that might happen at a play. The beautiful landscape views that you might get if you decide to take a tourist trip around the capital. So it's about leisure, it's about pleasure and it's about excitement. My next part, I'm stopping my trap for a minute and asking you guys to do a little bit of looking. I want you to compare these two images and contrast them. Where are they similar and where are they different? Just exercising or basic skills of official analysis between one of your prime images, right? The Vincent Van Gogh painting. This print, cortisol and by Japanese printmaker oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. He goes, are all kneeling. Good job. And where you're all starting is many of you were starting, is the similarity as Eric pointed, the iconography is almost exactly the same or the composition, you could say it's almost exactly the same when it comes to the body of the figure, right? A woman looking back over one shoulder so that we're facing her back into kind of three quarters degree perspective, holding with her sleeves, part of her ribs up. That's her little foot steps out. Her left foot steps out. From between these robes. Robes are kind of in action as if moving slightly away from us. The hair is pinned up with these elaborates cones and devices. And so the general composition is almost exactly the same. And as Drew rightly surmised, the woodblock is the original and the Van Gogh image is copied almost directly from the woodblock. And we can know this through that basic argument that you guys built of the iconography, the composition being the same, all of these details and proportions being almost exactly the same. That being said, there are plenty of differences. But again, with the idea that the one on the left is following from the one on the right can be built from the dating right, 188718 twenties. And also the near the exact composition and posture and organization of the figure. But again, That being said, are these really strong differences? Zach started us off and many others said this if the color is strikingly different. And that's because as I've pointed out, the material is different, right? You have oil on canvas on the left, and then you have polychrome woodblock printing on the right. Oil on canvas is reflective, and it's also built up with pigments, often mineral pigments suspended in a kind of oil binders substance. Whereas the pigments and the right are all water-based and they're absorbed into the paper rather than sitting up on the canvas. Meaning sometimes they fade with time and with exposure to light because they're water-based and on paper. And so this is less fiber than perhaps we would've been to begin with. But then goes, painting is more vibrant for variety of reasons that have to do with his style of painting as well. Jackie and Evan pointed us to this extra framing and the background. Graham, to the courtesan image by AE sin was a Japanese printmaker on the right. There's nothing going on in the background. It's all about her isolated, her form, her robes and her look, which both Cherry and Jessica talked about. Whereas the image on the left. As Jackie put, it is framed right? There's an idea of a kind of framed image with an extra dark orange boundary around the yellow, orange background behind the figure. And then outside of that blank framing device, there's a landscape of some sort, right? It looks like a group of reads, a frog, that's supposed to be Frog. And from a group of lily pads to Heron's or perhaps cranes and too little fisherman up in the background. So there's this layering of imagery has if suspended in midair or framed by this other landscape image. Our singular corners on these two things do not exist in the same plane of the same image. One is stacked on or collaged on the top of the other. Compositionally. Let's see what other, alright, and so it's a treat and Jessica both point out the facial expression is extremely different between these two. And this has to do with the way in which van Gogh projected a certain group of ideas on the facial expression of the image at right. Within the original woodblock printing. For Japanese audiences, there was a lot of subtlety in the ways in which iss No nose, mouth and eyebrows all work together to create a kind of legible expression to viewers within that culture. And a lot of it is built around the kinds of expressions used in Kabuki theatre as well. So this is an expression perhaps of surprise with the mouth slightly open and the turning over the shoulder, right? Whereas in our image over here that van Gogh makes from the original, we get kind of either it's a sneer or kind of a smile. She seems more flirtatious and giggly in comparison to our image on the right. But as you you surmised that both of these, the one on the left, is built off of direct access to the image on the right. And so we have to ask ourselves, how did van Gogh in 1887 see the image by A's and on the right, where did that access come from? Because Van Gogh never traveled out of Europe. Well, the print came to France as part of the opening up of trade between Europe and America and Japan. That happens in the 19th century. As you'll remember. As we discussed with the Bilbo or folding screen of the number or the Southern foreigners. Trade was limited in Japan for most of the 17th, 18th, and the beginning part of the 19th century, there was an isolationist policy in place. And the only people that could trade with the Dutch off that small island of Nagasaki. In order to create a more equal trading relationship. The threat of force was used by the American Navy in 1853. In 1854 to open up more trading ports in Japan. And so Commodore Perry is explicitly told to both to Japan in order to create a better trade arrangement. There are other factors that were at play. Too many of the white American whaling vessels that were whaling in the Pacific would shipwreck in around Japan. And when the sailors washed up on shore, they were killed because of the isolationist policies. This was another aspect of creating different sorts of diplomatic relations between the US and Japan. And once the US and Japan and sign this new treaty, the Treaty of Kanagawa, that opened up trade and more treaty ports than just the original site of Nagasaki. The European countries jumped on it and sign similar agreements as well. And so Commodore Perry, this naval officer from us, whose brother was Oliver Perry, famous for the Battle of 1812 on the Great Lakes in Ohio. He shows across with his giant smoky belching steam powered ships with its ironclad sides. Basically threatens to shoot his way into harbor to create this treaty. And by that threat, the Japanese are convinced that they ought to be signing this agreement. There's some other factors at play to it. We'll talk about next class in terms of the Japanese looking toward what was happening in China at the same time. And noticing that Europe had created through, threatened through, or these open treaty ports in China. And we'll talk about that next class. But for all of these reasons, the Japanese decide to sign this treaty and open up more trade that had existed over the last several 100 years. When first the US, and then with Europe and Russia, et cetera. And so it's by dint of this new access to Japan that someone like Van Gogh is receiving these Japanese prints. And it led to this fad for all things Japanese. Remember how last class we talked about Shin was IRI in the 17th, 18th centuries. In places like France and the rest of Europe, the passion for collecting goods, especially luxury objects that could not or were not made in Europe. From, from Asia. Same thing happened once access was granted to Japan and everything, Japanese became stylish in the late 19th century in America and in Europe. And just a few years after Commodore Perry forces open trade, trade arrangement with Japan. Prints like the one that van Gogh saw were available in print shops in Paris. And it really helped to kick off and solidify this fad for things Japanese, because Japanese CSMA, using the French term for it. And this manifests in a variety of ways. You get players. You get published narratives of diplomats going to Japan talking about what it's like. You get prints included in those narratives because prints were cheap, easy to come by, and helped again to give a sense of what life in Japan was like. Two people who had not been there yet. By the 18 sixties, there are whole shops in Paris such as the boutique to swap the silk. The silk shop there were devoted to Japanese imports, just things from Japan. And the silks that were brought over the various carved goods and folk objects. There's other kinds of luxury wares, whether it's lacquer or porcelain. And prints, created this fascination and seen in plays or novels like those written by the gung-ho brothers. These things taste makers in late 19th century Paris, in which the hero is reading and look is looking at a Japanese wood cut and then projects himself into the image and pretend as if he's traveling in Japan in his dreams. So this opening up of exchanged led to the flourishing of fantasies about what Japan was like that were solidified in. These has access to an ownership over the kinds of objects that were being exchanged. Objects like this print. And we actually, we actually have still the trace, tracing drawing that van Gogh used to define the contour and basic shapes of his later painting, which had been taken actually not from the original print, but from that's prints reprint in 1886 magazine called illustrated Paris, which was all devoted in that particular issue to the arts of Japan. And you see on the front of that image a version of the same woodblock print, somewhat closer to the original Van, Van Gogh's, but still slightly different look at the way in which you have sort of swirling design here in the foreground. Or these chrysanthemum petals here, rather than what's being shown in the original image. So Van Gogh is receiving it two degrees removed from the original when he draws is outline image and then goes on to paint a fall canvas that fantasizes about what Japan was like from, from his perspective. Adding details like the strange smile, right? This alluring smile instead of the sort of more tense look that the original image has. And this complicated backdrop, which is entirely invented. But which you can extrapolate from the way in which the printed magazine drops the image of the courtesan on top of another image of a flowering plum tree. So this is where Van Gogh is drawing the image from, from this new access to Japan. As has been reprinted everywhere in the fad for things Japanese. But as those of you who have taken Modern Art surveys, perhaps from my colleagues know, this is the time of impressionism, post-impressionism in Europe. And Vin goes, is usually not associated with Japanese imagery is so much easier associated with the new kind of painting that we call impressionism. And it's associated with the rise of the modern world with new kinds of technology and new ways of visualizing the world in 19, in the 19th century, beginning with certain kinds of artists in France. And the things that they painted in contrast to the kinds of historical painting or a painting of royalty that it existed before, were images of everyday folks. The middle classes of Europe are often described where the French term as well called the bourgeoisie. People who were neither upper-class lords are descended from royalty or people with, who were not landed gentry, but people who had come up through profit, through mercantile capitalist behavior often and into middle-class lifestyle in which they had time and money to spend, just like we talked about at in Japan. And the images of impressionism really give you the sense of the modern world is a series of spectacles and entertainments, right? You have this girl looking through the screen of bars at this obscuring smoke, which is caused by the train engine, which you can just barely see in the background. And he heard Governess is sitting with a puppy and reading a book as she's looking after this young child. And one of the factors that we think about with impressionism as a move away from or realist methods to the way to showing, the way in which a painting is kind of constructed, the way that it's an image made by a painter rather than an image that looked like or tried to look like the world and in any particular way. And this we also associate with the kind of ambivalence toward painting and toward image-making when you had photography and other kinds of print media, producing images that looked just as real as anybody could paint. Then the sense that the painting was a kind of special space began to be broken up and broken down by painters. And the way in which these images are showing how they're made are both about pre and image, but also showing its destruction almost at the same, at the same time. Magritte, SAS Baudelaire really is the person who helps define what modality is about, especially through the arts. At this time. And he writes by modality, I mean the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent things that you can't quite grasp. The half of art has other half is the eternal and immutable. So he creates this kind of contest, this ambivalence between things that are eternal and true and things that are ephemeral, things that disappear on you. And again, this should sound really familiar in terms of both what you're able to kind of think about today in terms of the modern world and ephemeral sorts of things. Examples of which, you know, you have here, whether it's being able to indulge in HBO Go entertainment anytime that you want or having. I don't think anyone uses Snapchat anymore. It's an older slide. But sort of in referencing that is about these ephemeral little inside jokes, as with Snap Chat or as with the kind of camp, an irony of repulse drag race. And all of that. The point of bringing up that is not to not only show you that I'm hip and cool, but also to show you that these are ideas that are being discussed in the 17th century with the burgeoning urban middle classes of Tokyo as father, kind of irony that Lydia mentioned in her comment and the fleeting entertainments of middle-class lifestyle. And so just to end this lecture, the last lecture and this lecture have collectively describe the sort of foreign fascination with East Asia. Whether it's Louis the 15th creating these elaborate tapestry, is that imagine for him what it's like to be in China. As based off of especially Jesuit letters, but also based off of the porcelain is another fine silks that were being traded from China at this point. Or whether it's Van Gogh looking at these cheap prints originally made for middle-class audiences, excuse me, in Japan, up at then become part of the revolution and middle-class kinds of visualization art that's happening in Europe at the same time. And so each of these is about a fantasy of East Asia and we call them by their French names. She was Ray and Japanese know, Chinois surgery really is in its full bloom in the 17th, 18th century. In Japanese ma that replaces Shun was there in the 19th century. As access to Japan opens up from the 18 fifties onward. And both of these are generally grouped under the broader term of Orientalism. An intellectual or academic term that was coined in the 19 seventies. That really talks about the fact that all of these ideas are really a product of European desire, of fantasy and colonialism. And that there is no such place as the orient, as the stress East Asia. There are particular objects and particular historical events stripes. But the imagine timelessness. I'm an image like this that is sort of about projection and about desire from a European perspective as what Sayid was talking about when he looked at the Japanese mothers shim library and particularly the fascination with the Islamic world that were also happening in the 19th century. As various European nations asserted power and colonial rule in some of those areas. So that's it for today. Again, you can drop any questions into the discussion board. That's also, I believe the last lecture before the exam 35 will review session on Tuesday, which is also the day that you should be out voting. If you don't come to class because you're voting, I am proud and happy that you are doing that and expressing your democratic right. And the review will be online as well, but be sure to contribute to the discussion board because those are mandatory for each exam. So contribute your question so I know what to answer. I can talk about them in a lecture and you can go back and watch the recorded version if you're out, stuck in a voting line somewhere. Otherwise, Hope you have a great day and it was good to sort of almost see you.


## [18. Nationalism](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/18-nationalism?module_item_id=2446636)
 Oh, Let's go ahead and get started with today's class before we kick things off. And this is our last kind of half module in which we cover the late 19th century through the 20th end of the 20th century in East Asia in three classes. And the final exam will incorporate these three classes of slightly more heavily, but we'll be covering again everything in the end the semester. Now previously I had mention that I was contemplating using of the prior exam questions on the final exam. But I realize now that if I do that and if it's open, that really defeats the purpose of having an exam, you can just go back and look at all of those of those questions. And so I will create a new exam. There'll be new questions, but there will be based very heavily on the material that was tested in the old exam. So you can go through and look at the old exams, as well as through all of the review quizzes to really get an idea as what will be the content of the final exam and how the questions will be posed. There will be no essay. But other than that, it will be more or less the same format as before. I believe we're at around 50 to 60 questions. So in terms of remaining work, we have left to do. You have your three quizzes and then you have the final final date is now posted on the canvas page. Will be a similar format to before in the sense that you can take it any time within those 24 hours of the exam, even though you have a schedule slot within your day to take to take the exam, just as normal exam calendar works. So are there any questions about the kind of last leg of this of this course of this class that we can answer now. You all seem pretty clear about what's going to happen. And so you can always come to my office hours afterward or chat with me otherwise about this. But let's move on to today's class where we're talking about nationalism. So I'll give you two texts to look at. And the first thing I want to start off with is just our discretion and chat prompt, which is to compare and contrast these two texts. One written by a Japanese scholar, an artist ochre, CAA console or attention. It's the introduction to his book titled ideals of the excerpt is idealism. And then it's an excerpt from an essay by the Chinese painter and art historian Shuo about Chinese painting. So take a moment, remind yourself of comp into these tax and we'll begin our discussion by comparing and contrasting their ideas. Yeah. Mm-hm. Whoops, ooh, wait for it before we get into the discussion. Mm-hm. You guys are pointing at some of the major kind of core themes, an a here. And each of them, as you're pointing out, is thinking and speaking from the perspective of their respective country, right? Thinking about Japan versus China. But as you know, Diana and diarrhea and other or the idea at Indiana, Daria D. And others pointed out. And as it to more people contributing Japan and the author who's talking about Japan, Korea attention or Kaku zone, two names, but has a very positive approach to the Japan in terms of diff-amp Asia overall. And at one of these Paul quotes describes it. Japan has had the great privilege of realizing unity of Asia with a special kind of clarity of clearing because it's in Japan alone. He says that all of Asian history has sort of accumulated. And Japan alone has these kinds of specimens that reference all of the other kinds of historical Asian cultures and ideals that he references in the former part of his introduction. And then at the end you, when it comes to this conclusion saying therefore, the history of Japanese art becomes the history of Asia and Asiatic ideals as a whole. And so this really props up Japan as the kind of primary cultural and historical power in Asia at this point. And what's interesting about that get into in this class. The way in which this is a divergence from many of the understandings that we've talked about in this class so far in terms of thinking about China as an origin point for Buddhism arriving to Japan via Korea. China has an origin point for various other kinds of culture like Zen, Buddhist culture and art. The art of teammate can write things like Shi Gu. So these old objects that come from China and become venerated because they have an attachment to even an even older period. You know, in mainland China that kind of a reverence for things coming from China is not flipped on its head and acquired tensions description. But instead, instead reader that Japan becomes the kind of repository or chi, of every good about Asia as a whole. And this idea of Asia as a whole, rather than Japan, China, or the various kinds of dynasties that, that rule over each space is a shift in a new direction in terms of thinking regionally in this compound of geographic and political spaces that is in many ways put on par with the west. Look at the title again, ideals of the east versus the ideals of the West of Western civilization. And this idea of East versus West as being described. Now, from the perspective of a nationalist Japanese cultural historian is a different mood than the relationship that Japan had to China before. And we can think of it really as a result of the contact of Japan with Europe and with america, that happens in the late 19th century, which we'll get into in the rest of this in this lecture. But notice some of the vocabulary that's being used to that last phrase, right? The national consciousness betrays again another way of thinking about what Japan is in nationalist terms. And the idea of Japan's having a kind of collective unified consciousness that is about a national identity. This is all important to note in the language of Oklahoma attentions, broad sweeping claims about but Asian art. And as you, as you all noted, in, in contrast, the painter and right should be home is describing something very different, right? He's very focused on Chinese painting in particular. But it's a sort of negatively inflected approach, right? That there has been a decline, a deterioration, as he writes in the beginning. And as many of you mentioned, I think Mindy mentioned at first, but Eric got to it as well. And so this question of what to write and Ben both identified as a kind of ideology of the first description, right? That's about this historical ideals, about the ethics of, of Confucianism, of even going as far as to reach toward Central Asia with Persian poetry in Arab chivalry or Indian thought. Collectively, those It deals with those concepts are being described in relate to what exists in Japan in the first piece of writing. Whereas in the second piece of writing it's very focused on Chinese painting and a perceived decline, right? But this plays into a kind of parallel with what we've just described in terms of the shift relationship between Japan and China that happens at this time with nationalization of Japan and eventually China and the nationalization of culture. Ever writer to be home that perceives his own painting called her as having gone through this period in which the deterioration of Chinese painting has reached its peak or its kinda Nadya, its low point. And then he talks in this grand terms about civilization, world ideas about civilization. And we'll talk about where those ideas come from in this class as well. And he says that the principal throughout the world up civilization is to avoid degeneration. So instead it's kinda progressivist developmental approach. Things keep getting better and better. But as he notes in Chinese painting, it hasn't been that way for the last 1000 years or so. And he goes on to elaborate and this kind of rhetorical move that says, and only, only in Chinese painting is today, 50 paces behind where it was 20 years ago. 500 steps behind where it was 300 years ago. Yada, yada, yada, all the way down to 800 steps behind where it was 1000 years ago. And he calls this a passiveness, right? A lack of engagement on behalf of the citizens. And this is a term as well. Think of yourself as a citizen in a nation is different than thinking of yourself as the subject of an empire. And this comes, this language comes with the actualization of culture. Any describes it as a lack of skill. And I think both Ben and I mentioned this too as a kind of decreasing the ability to depict the world in realistic terms, especially as a result of the kind of conservativism, as he says. He says that we can talk about improving our Eastern painting to a, notice that move as well. It's not Chinese painting specifically now, but eastern painting as a whole that is inclusive of Japan and China. If we go back and try and think about what painting, write a 1000 years ago, looking back to the past for an answer to the problems that exist with painting as he's describing it in the present. And so as Daria and Diana put it, both these are historically minded right? There. Eat drawing the lines of history in ways that suit the needs of the present moment. And both of them are designed around this kind of progressive in terms of development. In the Chinese painting contexts, it's really the opposite of development of decline, which is, as she been home describes against the ideals of what universally around the world at that point is considered civilization, right? You're not supposed to go into decline, whereas occur attention has a much more positive inflection, right? He's talked about. Japan as being able to buy a kind of birthrights, accumulate everything good about the rest of Asia. And so that's a progressive as positive kind of perspective. Now, to expand on that, I want to ask you not to think about that in relationship to both of these painting. Talk more in class, but how do you see those ideas possibly relating to what we're seeing in the visual material. Paintings, just try and take, take some guesses based on what you're seeing in the images. Hi. You may not be immediately apparent, but go ahead and take a step back. There's no wrong answer at this, at this point and will trend develop his ideas as we move on through the class. But alright, so dar is looking at the twitches by if you, if you've paid attention closely, right? The person who paints a, which is the same person who has written about Chinese painting, right? So you might think about, well, what are these ideas about turning around the decline of Chinese painting? How do those relate to this painting? That has dire has pointed out there's a kind of basic labor being shown here, right? This is simple country labor. So what might that have to do with, with things? The image on the left does not look like a traditional Chinese painting Caleb, ads. And that's true. There are many ways in which the image on the left is working against many the norms that we've thought about with Chinese painting and we'll elaborate on that in a minute. But Caleb, feel free to elaborate on why it's not, doesn't look traditional, right? And Ben continues on this. There's something new or different about the way in which it's technically painted and in which composed as well. And on top of that, the subject matter as well. So Eric, you might have swapped the paintings, kind of old guys painting is the image on the sort of more refined painting. And if you look at that painting on the right, what does it remind you of? And the image on the right is taking advantage of Buddhist symbolism. But as we'll describe in this, in this class, the audience is there not necessarily a Buddhist audience that are meant for this, for this image, right? And then we can think, especially in both paintings, Caleb, about that shading that you're bringing up and the use of tone and light to define the body, right? And so both of these are figure paintings. That's an important thing to think about. One plays on religious themes. One plays on an old tale called Old menu, moves the mountain. You're going ECN in kind of classical Chinese story. And then we'll get into each of those details in a minute. But think about the ideas of realism, about labor. Think about the ways in which one of them is playing off of traditions of Buddhism. And as we expand this class, you will understand kind of where those ideas rest on this new nationalized version of painting that's happening in both of these images. So it's come to one of the things local Core attention, wrote and ideas. She talks at Asia as one they did with the history of Japanese art is the history of Asia as all. And then contrasting that with this, some of the vocabulary that comes out and should be hones. Descriptions of the deficiencies of modern Chinese painting and how to make it better. He talks about Eastern painting as, as a whole and its collective understanding of Asia or east Asia, which we take for granted today as a kind of natural way to talk about a whole digital set of histories and cultures and microcultures. And micro history is many of which we've talked about over the course of the semester. And indeed, this whole class is structured around this idea of East Asia. This doesn't begin until around the turn of the century. It really is not a concept that there's a unified kind of core way to describe all of these different countries until the arrival of nationalist thinking. And I tell this kind of contrast happens when thinking about the culture of the West and the culture of the east, right? You saw the roots of that beginning with Shin was R0. And Japanese moved from the western perspective, sort of dividing out of these two prime large geopolitical spaces, the east and the west. And as these little note here, describe. Concept really only comes about in the 19th, 20th century as a counterpoint to the idea of the West. And the concept of East Asia has its origins within East Asia in Japan. And we read OCO tensions just shove all of Asia kind of washing up on the shore. Forgotten natural metaphor as Darwin pointed out, of, of Japan. Japan that begins to describe this kind of ownership can ship to all of Asian culture first. And those ideas trickled into the historical concepts of budding National China. And, and there are product of large for ideals of the nation-state and nationalism. But they also lead to impute, some, as many of you probably are aware. Japan through the beginning part of the 19th century conquers all of the majority of, Certainly all of Korea, but the majority of China up into and until the end of World War two in an effort to create an empire that's unified around is ID of Asia and Japan being on top of that kind of hierarchy. So go back a little bit before the Japanese empire during the 19 thirties and forties. And think about it, getting principle of what nationalism is. We might turn to this definition that's widely used across the humanities. And it comes from a sort of theory of nationalism put forward by Benedict Anderson in 1983, in which he writes, as an anthropologist, looking at the behavior of people who behave naturalistically, says in an anthropological spirit, I propose the following definition of a nation. It's an imagine political community. Now, imagine part and the community partner are central to this. He says it's imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow members. They don't meet them, they won't even hear of them. But in each of their minds lived an image of their communion, that sense of community, right? We're part of this one idea of being a nation, even though we don't know each other and whenever meet each other. Imagined as a community. Because regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that prevails in each nation, nation is always conceived as a deep horizontal comradeship. And ultimately, he says it's this fraternity that makes it possible over the past two centuries. Here he is writing from 1983, but he's talking really about the late 18th century up into the present. And the history of states being in a sense with the American and the French Revolutions. Ultimately as this fraternity that makes it possible over the last two centuries for so many millions of people, not so much to kill as to willingly die for such limited imaginings. And so. And what he's pointing to and he's really sort of interested in, in this section of the bucket and how it is that people commit themselves to things like war based on the ideals of being part of this horizontal comradeship, of being part of our mission. And what is striking to him as an anthropologist is that it doesn't matter that the people of a nation might have stark inequalities based on a variety of sources, high and exploitation, right? Whether that's a class of ethnicity, of gender, et cetera. That people will unifier if the nation and they'll sacrifice themselves for the ideal of being part of a nation. Now, that idea, as we said, really begins in the kind of Enlightenment Era of the 18th century and the revolutions of the US and France, and the establishment of new nation states as democracies with representational systems. And it doesn't in East Asia until the end of the night entry and arise as a result of foreign intervention according intrusion. And so if we think of a nation, which we can think of in the Chinese case beginning from 1912 onward. And if we think in the Japanese case of really from the late 18 sixties onward, when each of them are defined themselves as a nation. We'll talk about that later on in this class versus what it is Ed existed before an empire or a kingdom ruled by an Emperor. Or we have to think of a nation through some of these terms that anderson gives us as socially constructed. And that it provides a kind of sense of community that is political were part of the same polity. That is, we have a voice or representation within this nation system. And then incorporated within that part of building that idea comes the geographical aspect, right? This territory has always been ours. This culture is now Rs, right? And that collective we or ours, possessive of whole history is that we're not designed toward a national narrative. Incorporate just as clear attention has done with all of Asia in his description, he's incorporating hit these other geographies as part of the inevitability of the Japanese shared nation state ideology. That again, that important aspect that it's understood as a kind of equal participation among all the citizens, despite the inequalities that allows the nation state to really distinguish itself from the relationship of a Edison which would be the member of the nation state. But of a bone blinking on the word. An emperor has a subject for it. Our King has a subject, the FE, will over. And again, this comes into East Asia if a sort of semi colonialist intervention that we talked about last class. And it begins in Japan with Commodore Perry visiting the 150 is forcing Japan into the trade relationship with the nation of the United States of America. And the things that followed from that over the next decade and a half led to a revolt against the Shogun. Shogun was overthrown. Taco Shogun it ends, which brings an entity EDO period and a restoration of the emperor to the throne. But under a constitutional government. And this is referred to as the Meiji Restoration. And it begins in 1868. But then takes a little while to get entirely off the ground. The Constitution is not drafted until the 18 eighties. But the Shogun, it is overthrown. That puts an end to this idea of the Shogun rule that we had discuss going all the way back to our class on, on Zen Buddhism. That began in the 12th or the end of the game, pay wars. Since a new system is designed mostly like a nation state with as the kind of guiding figure head the emperor. So it's not quite a democracy in the sense that the US is, but it results from that intervention and from that exposure that happens to the Western capitalist and colonialist economic systems that you get this overthrow of the old form of government in Japan. And that leads to, again, a nationalist approach to thinking about into writing history that's encapsulated in the art or the production, the book that we read. In the nation state comes. There's other kinds of concepts that we describe as leading to the modern. And so we've talked a little bit in previous classes about enlightenment. Era is three in the West as coming up in many ways is a reaction in Western nations to the power of the church. The increasing weight given to philosophical, experimental science, philosophical argumentation, and the development of ideals that were outside of the authority of the church. And they were really about human civilization in many of these were based in a kind of reflection on the past that did a similar thing to what OK, require attention. Do they incorporated many different kinds of disparate history because that happened in the same geographic space of Europe and the Mediterranean era and created a kind of lineage of history that lead all the way back to the Greeks. And the Romans. And in those ideas of history, enlightenment kind of history. All human striving was toward an increasing set of progressive developments in the betterment of man, in increasing liberty for all people. And increasing reason and logic and aids to histories that are developed around the idea of the modern period being one in which liberal products and reason are achieving its kinda busy-ness, continually moving forward and progressing. Often. The modern and the ideal of being modern and be free, progressive and reason or logic based. In terms of argumentation, we're positioned against faction of the past as being outdated, as being teak or traditional. And so many of the traditions of the nation state. As you read an awkward tension or in Xi Bei home, our TPP as possibly deficient in relationship to the progressivist ideals of being modern or seen as quaint and old fashion, something to be overcome through the idea of being more modern. And so the idea of the modern is a historical concept based in these philosophies of progress. And it leads to this other idea of modernization becoming more modern, which is usually described in terms of technological and ideological progress. The invention of the things that I'm better, make better, the lives of the people or the citizens in a new state. And all of those ideas find their way into the writings of the people that we started off class with like quarter attention and should own. And they find their way into the writings first again of the Japanese. And this has to do with what happens after the opening of Japan back at NREL or common. Perry wants Japan has opened to the west to beyond the sort of limited trade of that part of Nagasaki. Various earners come if in Japan. Various Japanese go abroad to study in Europe and America and to learn about these modern nationalist ideas of the university, for instance, or sort of western progressivist history. In terms of how history writing or literature is, is conceived of. And when it comes to art and art history. And people in that exchange in the late 19th and early 20th century, Japan are named Ernst Federalists. And the author of the first piece you read for today, a booklet and attention. Federalist says, well, first generate ten of educators at the university level that come to Japan and teach in the newly established diversities that happen after the Meiji Restoration. Who's very young when he first arrived in Japan in the late 18 seventies was only in his twenties. He just finished his undergraduate degree at Harvard and philosophy and sociology. And then takes on a very important role of teaching SVM political anatomy at the University of Tokyo, which had just been established. As part of this progressivist nationalizing Japan in the late 19th century. His own interests though skewed toward the arts. And he helped to found and then direct the first art academy in Japan based on Western principles of what the parts were. And lest you think he was only really and, and making Japanese art more Western in its approach, he was actually an advocate for modernizing Japanese styles of art. And in the process defining what Japanese art was and what was the National Art and Art History of Japan fellows that intention, right, the first ma, io, histories of Japanese art and innovation art and got attention is interesting in part because he was one of the earliest students of federal OWASA. He helped him as a translator and the person on the ground to help with cultural hurdles to found this new Tokyo School of Fine Arts. And a lot of the ideas that he first received from studies with fellow Sapp. He then turned into his own versions of what a kind of nationalist history of Japanese art one. And became popular around the world. He gave lectures in America and in Europe about what Eastern culture was to a group of people who are already primed in their fascination for all things Japanese, as you know, with the cultural and visual art phenomenon of Japanese man that had overtaken and cultural sort of fads in Europe and in America, we discuss this when we talked about the Impressionists, impressionist paint. So these are two people we can think about in terms of their efforts to modernize and to internationalize what Japanese art history was. Which brings us to our painting. Whoops, beeping. This painting by a man named Olga. Olga, I was a student of the same enemy of painting that we discussed when we talked about the arrival of the Portuguese in Japan back in the 16th century. The inner kinda night and was a great, great, great, great, great, great, great set. No predecessor. And scepter to cotton on ho guy. Pool of painting had an established for 600 years at this point. And Crow who becomes a friend of federal Llosa, this guy who was teaching about art and art history from a Western perspective of this kind of progressive modernist approach to art in Japan for the first time. And he begins to install on many of the ideas that fellows and ocular attention are, are, are developing and putting forward about what Japanese art is and should be. That is it, that it should be based in a kind of tradition that is Asian? Asian in the broadest sense. But to be modernized and specific ways for contemporary audiences. And specifically in ways that spoke to kind of Western ideas about what art should be and what it should look like. So if we look at this painting, the iconography, right? The symbols are this. This is kinome, who was a bodhisattva. Is the Japanese name for guanine or the Bodhisattva of Compassion. And also the Bodhisattva devoted to reproduction. And if you wanted to child, you would pray toward condone or quantity and for child often. And here you have condone or the bodhisattva, the deity of compassion, pouring out those little vile while floating on this cloud, this halo behind him or them onto this sort of saintly 4B around this little pale child who's also floating high above the land scape. And from the Japanese perspective, this is the child granting Calhoun. Funny enough, this Bodhisattva, but this was not painted for Buddhist setting, is not painted Temple or a Buddhist practitioner particular instance was painted for a salon. It was happening in Paris in 1883. The slot or major exhibition venues for showing off art, impressionist and the impressionist, excuse them. Beginning at around this time, under the influence of people like phenol Alyssa, Japanese artists begin showing in some of these foreign salons as well. This image was painted or Paris and for the interest in Japanese wherein the causation and Oriental asean. Japan. And we have talked about that when we think about the image and when we think about the technique applied to and for the choice of this religious imagery, which as I said to a Japanese audience, would have figured as the Bodhisattva of Compassion and the child granting form. But Ernst phenol though so who later was the owner of this painting, renames the painting, he calls it the creation of. That title is direct the local rv to the idea of God on the rib. I'm Adam. God molding atom out of clay for the creation of woman happens later. And so you're seeing this conflation purposefully in the titling of the image and the purpose of the image, right, to show to European and says of Buddhist imagery with I'm Buddhist context and with Western religious thinking about how it is that the gods create man in an intentional kind of depression or suppression of the Buddhist iconography as Guanyin be compassionate one grants children. This is a more typical Japanese. What Guan Yin is, how guanine is often painted. Here you see guanine and the frontal perspective on floating on a cloud, right? So that's sort of iconography is the same with these robes that are flowing all around it. So therefore, you have a similar kind of heavenly, a fear ill atmosphere happening That's shown on the kind of floating on the clout, on the clouds above, above the earth or above the oceans. As a Mormon left, you have the use of gold pigment in many of the details. So that again, in a temple format, it picks up the reflective light in the dark of the temple space. And there's gold used in Hebrew, kinda on image, later image as well. But the naturalism that you describe in your visual analysis of the later painting by kinda WHO guy is really very different than the way in which the 17th century image of Canada It's portray it right. The candle and image on the left, the earlier one is much more static, right? Facing directly forward. The action is just on hand up and won him down in what is called the IMU drought or a hand gesture that also has a kind of symbolic. Meaning that this is, I believe the teaching, the teaching gesture. But the image on the right, again, looks much more like a figure in space, partly through the posturing, turning the body slightly two or three quarters ankle, partly through the natural gesture of just sort of letting something pour out of the hand. And partly through the use of shading and contouring of the figures. And that's most obvious in the child. And if you look closely at the child, you see that it's being shown from a perspective where you're looking up at the head from a kind of bottom view at a three-quarters angle. Something that comes much more frequently in Western depictions of like Cherubim or of figures also floating on a, on a cloud, but with a kind of sanguine natural pose to the body as if this were a real toddler, squatting and pointing down its mouth open, looking up to the adult and the kind of questioning tone. Furthermore, if you look at the eyes to the child, they're painted blue. It's not a common eye color in Japan. It's very, very rare. And this figure as kinda figure seems to be paused in mid motion as if they're doings, as if they're active. Whereas our older forms, Buddhist forms are much static, right? They're not in these sort of gestures that show the midway through completing some sort of activity. And then the last thing we might think about the nudity of the piles. This is not common in figure painting in East Asia show an anatomically correct boy. In, in that sense, that nudity is just, is just very uncommon in figure painting in East Asia. Whereas as many of you know from general cultural knowledge or if you've taken art history courses, the nude figure became the kind of expression of the ideals of humanity in not only Greek and Roman art, but also in later Renaissance art. And for no reason in particular, people are shouting naked all the time. This is not coming in Japanese art. That's another way in which we can think about a painting like this. Making. There's toward a more global or westernized audience. And the word that gets applied, this new form of painting. It uses Japanese visual narratives that uses Japanese iconography and often buddhist iconography to define what Japanese painting is in this new Nationalist thing of Japan. A term which we might contrast with our earlier form of thinking about this. The Amato, a painting of the Amato kingdoms and early kingdom in Japan. And the style of training people at this Tokyo Academy for fine arts was in this. Japanese style painting, which was progressive, which modern ASD, older forms of Japanese painting. By adding in naturalism, shading, by adding in of active focus on the human body and sometimes on the nude human body. And being really developed around these ideas of progress of progressive painting that becomes more visually realistic, right? That feels like the images in the painting are much more like the images that we see in the world and therefore was turning away from more stylized forms of Japanese painting that existed before. So that covers our kind of attempt to try and stand is very important shift in visual culture in Japan through the lens of overcoat tensions. Text that is helping to nationalize painting and then eventually leading to a kind of colonialists attitude of East Asia. Images like this which are doing part of that work, especially to demonstrate to Western audiences both the fetishized version of the Japanese passed and all the rest of this tendency of a kind of more nash naturalistic progress approach to painting the human figure and to painting Buddhist themes. There are any questions about that before you move to a similar group of ideas. In the Chinese context. We're going to look chat in a minute, the top. But we'll move on to the Chinese contacts. As we discuss and opens to the WEF, partly through this sort of imperialist mentality of Americans forcing open these trade agreements after Commodore Perry comes in and threatens war with Japan. If these treaties aren't, aren't signed. A parallel group. That's happens China just before Admiral Perry arrives in Japan. And the aggressors this time or the British. And the events really led to the decline of the Qing Dynasty empire. Or overwrap. Ours. The more is by which the British force open trade with China. As well as the major internal civil war that was happening in the 18 fifties, sixties called the typing civil war. And both of these events pretty much. It, the Imperial bureaucracy of Qing Dynasty China. The Opium Wars were instigated and by the way, who balanced trade deficits and growing over the 18th and early 19th century. The demand for all things Chinese, we talked about in the 17th century in Europe, led to the import of massive amounts of tea and porcelain and silk into the European economy. And to England in particular. The balance was always in the favor of China until the, until the English decided to try and rebalance by DO seeing products like opium. To trade with China. Opium was illegal in every open trade of opium was illegal in China. And the British and the Americans as well found ways to treat it under, under the radar illegally. And this lead to a tension at the major trading port in China, what's now Hong Kong. Anton. And it led to the officials who was overseeing trade with the West on behalf of the Qing government, dumping a whole bunch of opium that he confiscated that was illegal in China, overboard from an English ship. The English East India Company took this as a tip, aggression and declared war with the crowns blessing things, crowns blessing on China and sent their navy to force the Qing dynasty government to repay all of the opium that had been tossed overboard. And this led to a war that lasted three or four years and the 130s in early forties. And then there's a second war called the Second Opium War, or sometimes the arrow or in the 18 fifties and 18 sixties, which was instigated on similar pretenses. The British Navy soundly defeats the Qing navy. There's armed Forces defeats the imperial King fourth easily as well. And as a result, the British insist on opening up many more treaty ports for trade with China and China repay them not all the debt. I'm confirming that opium over to begin with overboard and destroying that property. But also for the expense is incurred in creating the war. And this pretty much drained the Ching dynasty imperial coffers of excess money or profit. They had to deal with a lot of sort of fundamental bureaucratic needs of an empire. It was growing bigger and bigger. On top of that, there's a major civil war happening in the heartland at this time. The typings civil war instigated by. The Chinese would be Chinese official who fails as imperial exams several times. And then because he has a vision based off of Christian missionary propaganda, that he himself is the other Son of God, that is, is his brother. He creates a pseudo Christian uprising that is also based in local Chinese martial arts and tries to overthrow the Qing government. And the efforts to put down both the British and the Taiping civil war leads to a dissolution. Centralized government in the Qing that takes another 50 years or so to completely apart. And really the sign that the Qing Empire had completely lost its respect in the world comes in the 109's in, in the form of a war with Japan. Is the reason for the war. The empire had self at the center of civilization in that region for centuries. And of course, Japan nationalize us and become stronger. As we retinal core attentions accounts, it begins to think of itself as a more powerful actor in Asia. And the war over influence in Korea happens because the Chinese Empire thought of as a kind of create of tributary states to the Qing Empire which had, had been in the asset is owed a certain amount of fealty and offerings to their neighbor and the Qing empire, even though career was self-governed. When there is an incident in Korea, both China and Japan send in troops to help stabilize the government. And in that moment, they come into conflict with one another over who gets to decide how to stabilize or influence Korea. Japan uses this excuse to test out its newly built westernized military on the Chinese Navy and military and very quickly defeats the much larger Empire of Japan, of China. And then the Japanese, the model of the western powers that had exercised their influence over Japan and China in the previous century or in the previous several decades, asserts the right to make pave or it's expensive. And war. And the rest of the world, this really meant something outrageous. Remembered the sort of esteem in which people like five minutes held China. It thought it was impossible that China could fall to a smaller state such as Japan. And yet they did. And the cartoons in Various British periodicals like Punch magazine, as you see in the bottom left here, show the sort of shock of this larger behemoth of China being conquered by the smaller David like figure, right? If we're thinking about the biblical idea of David and Goliath, the small guy beats the big guy. That surprise about those events are shown in from a Western perspective and cartoons like this. So all of this very poorly for the stability of the Qing Empire in China, which is overthrown in 191119 of a republic, a modern nationalist government is established in China, overthrowing all of these centuries of imperial rule with an emperor. And this new nationalists state is very unstable at first. Really in the 19 tens and 19 twenties, you don't have a phone getting nationalist government and said you have regional rule by various warlords. People who had often served in the previous king government and have amassed private armies to rule over various parts of China. And it's not until the 19, late 19 twenties that a nationalist government is fully established in Nanjing to rule over the rest of China through this, these new terms of Western, the Western nation state. And I wish an understanding of what China is through these enlightenment ideals about modern, about being a group of modern nationalist citizens that share and in their identity, their Chinese, right. And that takes her be defining of is. Is, is cultural myths that chart trying to modernize the new Chinese citizen in a western sense. Initially, as we've sort of foreshadowed, the Japanese building on their imperialist intentions over all of Asia. Invade China via their stable colonization of Korea by this point. And this leads to the Japanese involvement in World War Two. As Japan prize to conquer and lay claim over Asia, just as Germany is trying to do over Europe. In Japan occupies China during this time and very brutal occupation. That has led to a lot of interesting and difficult relations between Japan and China since the end of World War two. And next class we'll talk about how Chen bout of World War II and the Nationalist government falls to the Chinese Communist Party, which founds the People's Republic of China. So that's for next class. What we want to talk about this class is an artwork that's created during that period of occupation. And that's where a painting comes in and drink a lot. So I discussed our painter for, for this painting, Shi Bei home. That's also somewhat of an art theorist, right? An art historian. And he's written this idea about Chinese painting tree that it's been in a, in a kind of free fall or decline over the last 800 a year. And that brings us back to if we do the math, the Song Dynasty, where in paintings like core sheep, the spring, or in some of the realist style of painting that we associate with the courts. Like emperor zones depiction of himself with his ministers. That was the kind of painting that should they hold, held up as ideal and as being sort of set in, in the Chinese passed from the perspective of someone being educated in the 19 tens and twenties. In this new modern progressive idea of what history was at its history should be ever increasing in terms of its progress toward a better human reason and for better conditions for human existence. And zap, progressive ideal got attached to realist modes of painting. And so to set up the recent past is a kind of decline. Stages. The present are kind of modernist intervention, right? As we discussed before, modality is often position against a deficient predict. And as you all rightly pointed out, he focuses on technique, on technical skill. And so how does that relate to who should be home was and what his painting is in this particular painting. So should be home when he writes this article is so very young kind of firebrand writer thinker is just as early twenties when he writes this critique of what Chinese painting is. And he had studied abroad in Japan at the Fine Arts under the same men tap the Kugler attention and Ernst Fair Llosa had established from the Japanese perspective about nationalizing. Denote teaching art that is, and if you can, new styles of art that emerged out of the Asian passed. If techniques from the Western academic approach to art, things attached to realism in painting. That is, light sources, shading and contouring of the human body. A focus on the human body really is the vehicle for expressing various ideas. This is all grounded in academic painting. Comes the 19th century European Treaty, which is actually the exact sort of painting that the Impressionists were reacting against. That sort of irony here that to become modern in East Asia, to revert to a kind of painting. But the modernist painters of the late 19th century in Europe are reacting against realist academic descriptions of the human body. These are some of his early studies from time in Paris where he also wanted to study. My view is in Japan and abroad in Paris of a progressive style of painting that's still in Chinese painting techniques and skills. He helps to develop this concept of national painting or Chinese national painting, Galois Zhongguo. A. That term. We can read a shift to being about who the audiences for painting. This co, or the painting or the Chinese edition was not in use before this effort to modernize on a Western model. And it gets picked up with these progressivist tendencies of rewriting history in a Western modernist sects and audience at the new people of the state. Whereas painting before had really been focused on elite audiences like literati painting, like painting for the emperor as we had talked about. Now the audiences for images like this are the people write the medicines. And he talks about the citizens of the new nation in his, in his excerpt, right? And so it becomes, rather than elite audiences want write all of that kind of layered references to other layered reference, the past. What do the people need and what do the people, these new national or camaraderie, a citizen? What do they need? How does this image serve that? So on one hand, just in terms of its texts, this painting is serving the people in the sense that it was created during the Japanese occupation of China, which is important to subject matter. She may hold during this occupation was not in the occupied zone. He had fled south. He aligned himself ideologically with the Communist Party air. He was traveling abroad in Chinese communities that existed in India and in Singapore to try and raise money for the refugees that had fled this major cities of the north and in the heartland in China because the Japanese had occupied them. This particular painting was MIT ID for our audiences that were part of his fundraising campaign for relief efforts. And IT, it tells a story that is it from at least the fourth century BC, Chinese fable of old menu moves the mountain. And in that story, all Menu who you see here, talking to this woman and child, gets it in his mind that in order to create a better trade from sense for his little village, he needs to create a road that brings trade through to his village. But there were mountain standing in the way. And so he gets it into his head that he can move the mountain. For the phrase comes from and the title. You move a mountain by destroying it bit by bit. And of course, this is before there were explosives. And so it has to be done by hand. He begins the effort. He pop-up, it's all sons into the effort. His son sons get conscripted into this effort to break down the mountain to build a road. And many of the neighbors in the village get convinced to do this as well. That old menu. And explaining his purpose, he says I'm going to die before this is achieved. But my descendants, descendants, descendants who will be better because of it. And if we persist through generations, we can move Mount means literally to ourselves. So this fable is really about setting a goal that might be impossible. It's about purse. It's about change in additions, shoe are given in order to better yourself. It's about various generations collaborating and working together. And then its event about the reward that comes from that persistence and perseverance. And the fable is being used here in order to talk about persevering against Japanese occupation, Red Mountain being the occupation of Japan. If we persist, people might die in the process, but we can't defeat this enemy. This, this, this mountain ends the way of progress. And so that is the political message in this fable that should Mahoney's using abroad to try and raise money for the refugees. And there is in which the composition at the layout of the painting are really designed to show the modernization of these old fables toward contemporary uses. You might think about that idea of the gesture right? Of being stilled, mid motion, hears. And you talking to this woman and her on who's still in mid motion while eating. Her mouth is open. My hand is on on the child and we're seeing ONE from the back, three-quarters angle right up. Almost all figure painting before this, if we think back to glue catcher at this early figure painting that discussed in this class, you're very clearly seeing each of the figures or their faces, their outline, their importance is sort of shown in a hierarchy. But the main figure in this painting, we'll menu, is shown looking away from us while his son's perform most of the work in the foreground. And we have wonderful scene that unifies all of these different figures. But the figures are not repeated in this large horizontal steam, which was meant to be seen all at once. It is a long format, but it's not a hand scroll it. So it's a very large painting that's meant to be seen in one viewing. The distills this moment where these men are kind of mid action. You can also think about the use of buy-in and wash. For instance, this relatively sort of bulky figure shown also from the back is shown so that light is definitely green cross one side of his body. There's a specific light source in this image and hears. Be home study with charcoal. For this figure, shown with musculature, with shading and with again a kind of foreshortened arm and a leg that seems to be disappearing into the scene. It's a figure in motion and inaction. And yet materials, paper, ink, and the brush to make this are the same as classical Chinese painting that was very important to, should be holding. And the other national painters of Japan, amino, China at this point. You should also look at the subject matter and think about that in relationship to the politics of showing this image to South Asian audiences. That's why you have a, a Pulitzer rhinoceros and elephants. And that's why the, the physiognomy of the features of these men. They have curly hair and they have much, are, there, is there much more of a kind of South Asian version of what it means to be Chinese. And this was intentional for the audiences that we're trying to be brought on to this relief effort. And then last thing we'll move to this idea of the human body. Again. These figures shown with heavily be musculature, shown in the nude, rarely existed in China painting him. The closest you would come would be images like these Harrison Street characters. The lack of clothing, the display of the nude body and especially the heroic male nude body was not, was not something that existed before painters like she may go abroad to study in, in the West and bring back this idea of the heroism of the muscular knew it, and particularly the male nude. And so this image would have been shocking to a lot of Chinese audiences at the time and should be homed inversion. This not only in national Chinese painting, which wasn't realized, partly by the material paper, ink, and brush. Yes. Did versions of it in oils and I'm in there several versions of this that exist. And as move into next class, we'll talk about Mao Zedong as use of the same parable. A whole menu moving the mountains, which again reinforces historical context for this image with you. For the relief efforts by Schubert home, who was at this point affiliated with the Communist party in order to show the effort of moving past the Japanese occupation. And that is exactly the kind of symbolism embedded in this national painting with materials being nationalistic, stories being uncertain, modernized version of a national ancient. And he's story and the figures being modern and solve the ways we've just talked about in terms of composition, line and wash, shading and the sort of heroic nude figure. And so both these images in a sense to answer or lost, or one of our two questions are helping to connect and divide this growing sense of East Asia as a whole. Not just Ching Dynasty China or took over Japan, but of Asia as a whole. If we think of the Shiba home painting, it is there tonight. The Chinese and the Chinese abroad in communities, immigrant communities in places like Southeast Asia. To understanding what it means to be Chinese that is resisting the passion of wanting this Japanese, though it's meant to kind of national mentality and enough to resist occupation and consolidation of the state to under the Japanese ideals. The other painting is, as it were, Ember, meant to modernize Japanese painting, to nationalize it, and to present an image of Japanese traditional painting with Western characteristic to foreign audiences. And to show to the salons of Paris sort of sophisticated, yet still traditional modes of making art that people like OCO, our attention and our fellow. So we're developing in the new nation state of Japan. And eventually that mentality leads to the occupational printer and assigns certain leading to a division within days as it's trying to express that sense of unity that 2k retention talks about. That's for today. Very full description and I'm parched. Again my office hours, if you have questions about any of this. But until then, I hope you have good afternoon and enjoy the sunshine. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.


## [19. Communism](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/19-communism?module_item_id=2446637)
 Alright, we might as well started with class. Today we are talking about the effects of political changes that come with communist regimes in China and in North Korea, and how that affects art and visual culture in both places. And so let's start off with our reading, which comes from the set of talks given by Mao Zedong at a forum on communist art and culture in 1942 at a place called the Yan'an. And I want you to read through the reading again. And then in the comment box, provide some quotes. It helps you to connect in terms that Mao Zedong is putting it. Communist or socialist culture and art forms. Take a moment, go through reading and we'll use that to kind of kick off our discussion about how art and politics are connected through communist ideals. Oh, well. Yeah. Yeah. Alright guys. So as if you pulled out in your notes, the key idea here that runs through all of this, through this sort of structure of this thinking is the idea that art and class are combined event. An art serves a particular class mentality, which is something that I think Daria first pointed out and elaborated on when she talked about how the proletariat art is often denied by this other class, the bourgeoisie. And then Matt added that the imperialists on top of that are also denying the proletariat art. So he's talking about these distinctive classes of people that relates to the Marxist, communist mode of thinking about how a culture is organized. And this idea that runs through this, that, or the art of a particular class serves the needs and ideals of that. Class. And as Diana and I haven't pointed out, via the proletariat art or the communist art is art that has meant for the people at large. Again, differentiating between these kinds of art that serve different kinds of class ideals. But as Nike pointed out, aren't still needs to have high-quality. This, otherwise it is not effective in terms of serving the needs of from this perspective, the proletariat or the communist ideals, right? And as Mindy and Ethan point out there, within this mindset, politics and art are unified. An art within a communist mindset is there to serve the proletariat revolution. And as these highlights, the sort of pull quotes that I've, I've emphasized show, they've reinforced the idea is that, that you've put forward. And this idea that a kind of art for beauty sake or art for the sake of making heart from a communist perspective doesn't exist. Instead, art is always serving a certain class ideal. Whether it's the proletariat, whether it's the landlord and feudal class, the bourgeoisie or the imperialists. And then each of the arts and literature made for these groups of people serves the needs of those people. Within the Communist system, it's the proletariat that is a laboring classes that are emphasized and that are promoted. And so the emphasis within Mao Zedong discussion about art and politics are really on what kind of art serves this labouring class, proletariat class. And the art that serves that class did out in your discussion that, that has a revolutionary political content, but that it's also engaging and sort of perfection of artistic form as Mao talks about it, it has a certain kind of artistic quality. And as we might elaborate, further question, well then, what does that art of high-quality that serves revolutionary goals of the proletariat, which is all the things that Mao Zedong sort of emphasized. What does an art look like then? What does it mean to be high-quality? I serving the ideals, high-quality art that serves the ideals of the proletariat yet not B, for our sake. How does art serve politics? And in the discussion, Daria already jumped the gun on this. The emphasis really is on the everyday phenomena of life for the common worker. As Mao Zedong elaborates, writers and artists need to concentrate on such everyday phenomena and typify the struggles and contradictions of life. And artwork should wake and an awareness in the large masses of the working class to give them enthusiasm and to unite them in the struggle to transform their environment. Politically and what Mao Zedong was emphasizing in this discussion at the Yan'an Forum on literature and art is the role that art can play in doing that, in motivating people toward political or revolutionary ends from the Communist perspective. And without it, he ends this section anyway. Without art, without literature, you cannot as effectively motivate the proletariat, the working classes toward revolution. And here's some examples of art produced under ESA, ideal under Communist rulership in China. Some of which we'll go into in a little bit more detail as we move forward. But we might ask ourselves, now just as we look at these images and of course, the image we're emphasizing is the image in the bottom-left corner. How do these artworks serve that purpose of inspiring or firing up the masses? Be laboring peoples of China to throw off the ideals of art for art's sake, to throw off the bourgeoisie attitudes and the imperialist or feudalistic attitudes that Mao Zedong is criticizing that he sees as opposite to the ideals of communism that promote the working classes above these other classes of people. So to answer that question, we probably want to back up and think about, well, what, what is communism and how does it find its roots in China? Where does, where do these ideas come from? And how are they shaped by the particular environment that they find in the early 20th century in China. So for those of you who don't have a kind of handle on these things. This is just a really brief description of how Communism sort of came to be. It begins with the ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which we generally classify under this broad term of Marxism. Marx was philosopher, writer, political scientist, economist, and journalist in the mid 19th century. And he actually wrote about the Opium Wars in China being very critical of the imperialism. If those wars signified to him. And he within is mode of thinking about how history had led to this development of politics and economics that seemed to be sort of spreading across the 19th century world that really how to put it. That really devalued the majority of people. It world's part of his sort of journalistic career is spent on pointing out all of the inequalities that happen with industrialization and globalization in the 19th century. And how the common person was actually getting a worse force deal out of this sort of systems that we're developing as a result of industrialization in globalization. And as he looked across all of these sorts of inequalities in the world around him that was rapidly changing with this increased connectivity, with the move away from a kind of agrarian based economy and one that was much more based on trade and global trade. He created a kind of template or progression that begins with societies that are organized around what he called feudalism. In which landlords have control over the peasants and the peasants over the landlords labor and are supported on land owned by the landlord. But the landlord is ultimately in control in this sort of feudalism. He describes throughout the world both new European perspective, but also in areas like India and China, et cetera. Then, throughout the enlightenment era, there's this development toward capitalism where you have a system, best AI system that is not based as directly on the kind of labor you put in to land, but where labor hours get divorced from the thing produced two, we have all this excess in the middle of profit that as essentially created through classes of people that profit off of other people's labor or the bourgeoisie, which we talked about when we talked about the rise of the middle classes in Japan and in Europe, in our class on prints and then go. And in an ideal Marxist progression, e laboring classes would claim equality through the assertion of rights, through revolution against the oppression from the bourgeoisie or the feudal landlord classes. And institute a shared an equal kind of representation of, sorry, I just saw something out the window in my mind, like short-circuit. The working classes, the proletariat, which is the work for the laboring classes in this increasingly mechanized world of the 19th century would rise up and claim a right over their labor and, and profit. Rather than having the bourgeoisie or the landlords profit off of it. That is, you would directly profit from your labor put in. And then the ideal system from a Marxist perspective, is one in which all of those social classes are completely. Obliterated. There is no difference in social class. And that is this sort of idea, last stage of communism, where everything is shared equally, equally among the people of nation. And no one is taking advantage of profited off of for their labor. And so this system of thinking is really developed within the European context. But in terms of observing what was happening in the world and the increasing inability for the, the basic laborer or whether that's a farmer, factory labor are increasingly to have any sort of benefit from, from their labor at the other people who are benefiting off of that, that labor and crustal then as a result of these sort of colonialist in capitalist endeavors come with globalism. As those ideas come to China, they come in part via the connection to Russia, major neighbor to China and one of the first communist states in the world. And a particular sort of strand, Marxist thinking called Leninism is, is what is promoted primarily in China in the early 20th century. And this idea emphasized the act of revolution in particular. And the idea that you couldn't motivate the majority of people toward revolution, that a real revolution for the o, or the protest spirit for the working. This had to be instigated by a vanguard that has a smaller group of idealists, the avant garde that promoted revolution. And then of course, from that small group led a kind of wave of revolution that would, that would change the politics of a country and the economics of country toward a socialist or communist structure. So as ideas arrive in China, there were arriving right beginning of this nationalist period that we talked about. Last class. When things are very messy, the Qing Empire has just collapsed. But, uh, well, Eyes, nation state has not rushed in to sort of fill that vacuum for much of the teens and twenties, China is, I've ruled very locally by warlord and warlord influence. Some old general, one of the old General Yuan Shikai tries to assert a new emperor ship with him as the new emperor. And there are a lot of competing ideas coming in from contact with Japan, with Russia, with America, with Europe about how to best organize the mess that has politics and economics of this new unsteady nation of China. And this is where the Communist Party begins. Hired by the revolution in Russia, which happens just a few years earlier. Because while Leninism, this idea of sort of an avant garde Leading the Revolution is so prominent in the party was founded just a few years after that revolution in Russia. In China, in Shanghai in 1921. Before that happens, D is Leninism and Marxism have to be translated into Chinese. And the person who's most credited with creating vocabulary for those ideas in Chinese is doctoral, who is a librarian at the University in Beijing. And he writes a kind of prime, a simple introduction to what Marxism is. And it's published in New Youth Magazine, one of these magazines that briefly came into last lectures class when we discussed the idea of modernizing China. And many of the essays in discussions in this magazine dined to introduce the Chinese populace at large, right, the average citizen to this, these new cultures that were coming into being translated in places like Russia, Japan, and America, in various European countries. And the emphasis on that short introduction to Marxism that was published in 1919. We're focused particularly on this idea of class struggle and capitalist exploitation. And some of those ideas are the ones you pulled out of Mao Zedong n's S discussion from several decades later. That each class there's a certain set of ideals that support your position in thinking about rightness to be in the capitalist bourgeoisie class or in the landlord class, or in the proletariat class. And that art and literature is always sporting That kind of mindset in you. But classes, just by nature of the system and the capitalist system of profit, that leads to profit kinda moving upward to the middle, upper, middle classes and then to the landlord or elite classes as well. It's a system that is capitalists always has us struggle. Or the various people of these different classes are competing with each other. And art and literature reflects those completing competing ideas as well. And that this all happens because within a capitalist system, exploitation must take place. So this is the set of ideas that are introduced. First Vm marks, then Russia and Leninism translated into Chinese by these sort of new intellectuals of the fault sort of, of the uncertain nation of China in the 19 teens and twenties. And ideas that were being translated into Chinese were. In many ways, antithetical or opposite to the approach of the Nationalist Party which eventually gains control in the mid 19 twenties over China and has the semblance of an organized nation state, democratic structure in place to begin to sort out how to rule over China. Not as an empire now. And you might sleep and think about these terms to the top here as the sort of key ideological differences between the Nationalist Party, the Chinese Communists. The Nationalist Party thought in terms of a citizenry, right? As we talked last time, that ideal of nationalism is a bit far. But parts at, that citizens enjoy equal rights and equal represent representation. And a nationalist is also based on profit based economy, right? The capitalist economy, where advantage is got and profit ensues from Advantage. And those ideas on the opposite side of things from the Communist perspective take very different forms, right? The communist perspective is all about enabling the basically the proletariat classes rather than sort of the citizenry of the Nationalist nation-state and believes in an equal distribution of profit. And that everybody labors for that. That's kind of equal distribution that nobody's labor has taken advantage of. Which is very much the opposite of the sort of capitalist system of profit, profiteering. And so these two parties are at complex with one another from the very get-go because their ideals are antithetical to one another. For this period of instability, especially in the early twenties before the Nationalist Party stabilizes thing. The Chinese Communist Party has encouraged I other communist regimes in the world to unite with the Nationalist Party despite these differences in ideals. And the common turn the ISS International, which is an organization that London fountains in Russia to promote Communism abroad, insists that despite these ideological differences, a united front before him between the Nationalists RD and the, and the party in China. And this lasts until the late 19 twenties. When the civil war breaks out between the Communist Party and the Nationalist party. At this point in time, the Nationalist Party has more resources, more connections with nations abroad. And really has the advantage over the Chinese Communist Party and drives them eventually on what's Within sort of Communist narratives described as the long march. Communist historical narratives talk about this period in the 19 thirties, during the middle of 130s, where the nationalist parties trying to route out and destroy the Communist Party. Driving the remnants of the communist party on this long and arduous journey through the mountains and heartlands of sort of deepest most rural China in through Sichuan, Hunan Province, Sichuan province. And up eventually in to a city or a small town called Yan'an. The reason why the Nationalist Party doesn't completely eliminate the Communist Party is because this is the point where Japan decides to embedded. And so the Nationalist Party is distracted by these other needs, which gives the Communist Party Time to recoup time 2t and time to think about their approach to motivating proletariat the working classes of China toward an ideal Leninist marxist system of politics and economics. And they set up in this place Yan'an decade consolidating power, rethinking the ways in which they're approaching their movement. And also collaborating to some degree again with the Nationalist party to draw about the Japanese who have invaded and are nearly successful in creating a whole East Asian empire, as we talked about last time. And this is where our reading occurs in this moment where the Communist Party is not being pursued at a kind of uneasy truce with the Nationalist Party. And is at the, at the point of what is an ideal communist system for China and its form. In particular that Mao Zedong, who many of you probably heard of, who becomes the chairman and, and leader of communist China. It's where he really begins to, through his charisma, through his thinking and through his sort of networking abilities, where he begins to consolidate his own power within the party. And it's where a certain set of ideals about what communist Chinese culture will be like as opposed to in many ways, communists culture or elsewhere. That's where those ideas formed in these debates and discussions recorded in the debates on art and literature at Yan'an that your excerpt came from. As you read in that, in that excerpt into the discussion there, how to drive out. To use art and literature, right? To inspire the masses to drive out imperialism, right? You can read that in terms of the Japanese feudalism, which is the kind of old classicist ways of thinking and structuring labor. The labor and classist landlord classes in China. And the bourgeoisie, right? The sort of middlemen, these fat cats who grow wealthy off of other people's work. One of the primary art forms that becomes popular is woodcut printing. Now you'll remember that would cut. Printing has this long history in East Asia that predates woodblock printing elsewhere in the world and that we looked at in one of our earlier, says, a ninth century illustrated Buddhists to suit beverages. First illustrated book in printed, printed book, world history. But the wood cut printing cults fine way into 19 forties. Revolutionary Communist culture is one that actually comes from, from Europe and particularly comes out of the various World War one and World War two. Movements toward populist art that take advantage of woodcut printing. As an art form. That as an art form that focuses on simple indirect images, often in black or white. Tone. The reduced to kind of the most effective message or gesture. And the idea that wood cuts are associated with the working class is really comes out of the various revolutionary cultures of Europe and Russia. As an example, we might look at this 1923 print in the middle. Some lope hatha Colpitts, who was an expressionist printmaker in Europe, decrying the kinds of post-World War One. Scenes that were ravaging Europe where starvation, death, post-World War one continued to depopulate and cause well heartache, I guess, and for difficulty. And it's this sort of highly gestural black and white image simplified is usually revolving around the kinds of emotions and gestures of the human body that finds its way into prince. Likely why's roar China or China roar from 1935, where you have a bound nude figure struggling against the ties and. With whatever ability he has, with his mouth, right, with his voice. A kind of revolt against the oppressive forces of imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism in China. And those ideals, again, are serving the Communist Marxist EST, approach to what politics and economics should be. And then it's even laid out in a kind of more didactic or direct way in this image by Gu Un, where the landlord class is being directly criticized by his Farmers who are insisting on a lower rent and insisting that the rent rates are too high. And so again, these images are simple. They are didactic. That is, they have a message to convey the, teach him a message. And that message is easily legible, not only in the kind of print itself with gestures of opposition to this man who's dressed differently. We seek at the table and it's obviously wealthier by many of the other kinds of attributes, whether it's as close or table. And these peasants who are asserting their rights and the weight of their sort of need against, against him. And when I think about that a little bit in relationship to the painting we talked about last class. Although we talked about this painting and nationalist terms, Shi Bei home, the painter was also surfing and was also a proponent of communism at this, at this point. And this idea of the sort of gestural active body that conveys a really obvious message of labor in this scene was central to some of the images we just saw and central to the idea of the laboring classes being able to assert their rights for once in history. And Mao Zedong talks about the sames, sorry, that should be home talks about in his image or described in his image, right? The idea that the Chinese Communist Party can dig up these mountains using the metaphor of the mountains and the story of old, old menu moves the mountain. And then if the masses, if, if the large population of working classes, which population-wise is greater than the bourgeoisie class or at the landlord class. If they rise up, then they can achieve anything they want. And that's the message that milestone reads, the story of old menu. This is the message that should be Holdings trying to convey in his painting. And that kind of background about how it is that with the politics and economics of early 20th century China. Within the framework of thinking about what literature it has to do within a communist system. I'll Zedong has described in his talks at the UN on form. That's where we might consider our first object for today, which is not a piece of that, was that an image, right? It's an image-based art. And so in many ways it That is different than Examples of easily understood direct, bodily kind of gesture driven images that convey a direct and simple political message that we've looked at before. And as we'll expand, this set of four words, really mean you bought the People's Daily newspaper, is just as tied to those ideals of communism as it is to older ideals that would seem to contradict some of the primary concepts of communism, of overthrowing the elite ideas of the past. So these four words are written by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong to become the header or the sort of titled image for the Communist newspaper, The People's Daily, which is still the most pop newspaper in check. Today. Mao Zedong writes this in his own very distinctive style of calligraphy. And rather than having a kind of normal, typical type font like you see in these images. It's his calligraphy that gets transferred. The image of his writing that becomes the mast head for the People's Daily newspaper beginning in 1946 and all the way through to today. So whether you know it or not, when you pick up the People's Daily, you're looking at the handwriting amounts, donors, the thing that you see in the newspaper. And what is one of the thing that is important to think about here is that the publication of the Communist newspaper coincided with the need to revolutionize the way in which language functioned in China. Much of official course in pre, nationalist China was grounded in some of the sort of old antiquated elite illusions that we associate with literal thinking, right? Quoting Confucius or quoting other variants philosophers from the past like true she, the Neo-Confucian philosopher. The means to make a kind of political or economic argument. And within the New Culture Movement in China, the communist and socialist movement as well. There was an effort to make language simpler, to make written and spoken language more the same. And a big part of that was actually simplifying the system of writing. So we read an excerpt from an essay by Lucian, who was a famous revolutionary up this period and an author and writer. He talks about the need to reform writing in order to make the population unified around certain ideas, people had to be literate. And he says, you know, this is the basic difference between civilized men and savages. You have writing and through writing and convey your thoughts to the rest of the, rest of the world. And to posterity. You might hear of angst features. To the hunting, the Orchid Pavilion. There. The idea that your words the von after you and continues China have writing. But the writing is divorced from the will of the majority of the people because it is, as he says, couched in crabs or archaic language, old-fashioned and describes outmoded archaic ideas, that is to say in modern China. And these ideas and these languages aren't, aren't useful. All of these ideas belong to the past to see say, and therefore they're worthless to them. So are people in the present because they're unable to understand each other. They are unable to use the same written language to communicate there like a great dish of loose sand. That's the metaphor he uses. That is, each of them sort of operating separately but not collectively. And again, the collective idea on is central to communism and socialism. So part of the effort to get rid of these old archaic ways of writing came, came and the basic process of how you write individual characters. The simplification from classical scripts to simplified scripts. For instance, here you have the character shoe, which is verb to write. It's also the noun for a book. And on the left you see how it was written before the modification and simplification of language. It had 12345678910 strokes versus the simplified form which has 1234 strokes. So by cutting down the number of strokes and simplifying the written language, more people were made literate in, in, in China, which led to the communication of ideas across the country where different dialects would separate different kinds of Chinese citizens or the proletariat depending on your, your mindset. And this is part of what is happening. In the context of publishing something like the people, People's Daily newspaper. Whereby if you increase literacy and you create a newspaper, another form, a national newspaper, other form of promoting a unified ideal and a unified group of a unified kind of source of primary formation for the Communist Party. Part of what you're doing there is making sure that everybody is working with the same kind of basic facts, information, and ideas. But what's curious about this effort to simplify language, to unify the working classes that we can think of with the People's Daily newspaper. It is written what we might think of as an archaic or old fashioned way of thinking about rating. That is, its calligraphic. It's not simple, simplified type font. And it's written by a specific person whose style you couldn't recognise in writing. And this is or shouldn't be ideologically if you're trying to maintain a kind of a purist I idea, it should be the opposite of the communist approach. That in turn, this excerpt from a play called The mountain village by Eugen 1947. So before the communist party takes over. And I love that happens. And there's an old and who says, wow, look, pick these characters. Look at this calligraphy. They're written very well. In fact, I know who wrote them, who could have written these characters except for my honored uncle. This calligraphy is extremely beautiful. And the communist leader responds to the old man's response, this old Matt's statement by saying, quiet down from France, he should not debate these insignificant questions. Calligraphy has no significance for us now. Characters only exists to express our thought that has its sort of utilitarian need for writing. It doesn't matter if they're pretty or not. That's all irrelevant. And so you can hear goes mouth don't zone thinking here from just five-year for, from his talks that you've read about. The idea that it shouldn't be art for art's sake, great beauty is not the purpose of art or of calligraphy. And I'll put that there are other aspects within this dialogue that are that can be criticized from a social perspective, right? First of all, you have an old man and representative of the old ways of thinking. And he said, my honored uncles must be the person based on the style and based on his learning that Roche, the ease and the calligraphy is beautiful. We've just talked about how beauty is not the objective within a communist socialist attitude toward arts and literature. But also this idea that you can identify a person base ten of calligraphic style. And that you would raise that person above all other people because of their stylish. This is again, not the point or purpose of the arts within this idea of unifying and motivating the people toward revolution and the hierarchy there of having an honored uncle is also perhaps opposite to the communist ideals here. So then we have to ask ourselves at the header of the People's Daily newspaper, which would, if it's being ideologically consistent. You know, avoid these ideas of calligraphy. Avoid these ideas of a specific individuals. Gestural marks being recognizable, right? A person's handwriting. Why are those contradicted with the use of Mount stones calligraphy on the masthead. And it wasn't just their Mao Zedong fancied himself in many ways as a gifted poet and calligrapher. As he was often displayed as somebody with a kind of brush in his and a2, right out. Calligraphy. Sometimes calligraphy that was conveying ideas from this archaic past, such as Classical Poems and mudstones. Calligraphy is visible everywhere in China today, not just at the head of the People's Daily newspaper, but he also wrote the headers for many of the Chinese universities that were established in the middle, early and middle part of the 20th century in China. And so his handwriting and sort of sprinkled throughout the provinces on major landmarks, major institutions of the state. And it's also sort of more personalized areas as in here where you have Mao Zedong calligraphy transcribing a Tang dynasty 19th-century poem by the famous poet Domo. And so again, there's a contradiction here between the ideals of what art and literature should do and the way in which Mao Zedong is manipulating Cliff Murphy to his personal advantage by conveying a sense of his presence and everybody's daily life as head of the newspaper or on these types of these major institutions in most major provincial capitals where the universities are often located. And again, we think back to our metaphors of the bodily gesture in calligraphy. And the idea echoed in that excerpt from the play, that you can understand the way somebody thinks through tracing their calligraphy and facing how they move and compose their characters and their body is somehow President, even if they'd been debt entries through this aspect of following calligraphy and following the ideas as well style of the calligraphy. And taken advantage of by not only the literati all the way through Chinese history, but through emperors as well. If you go to the Forbidden City, major signs that mark each of the sort of make buildings like that. Tahoe n. These are in the handwriting of the Emperor or various emperors from China's past. And that way the emperor's marking has presence through the gestures of his calligraphy. And the presence of the calligraphy is seen to convey the presence of the person who made it come all the way back to the sort of classical notions of calligraphy. And this is what Mao Zedong as repeating here. Even though it seems to be contradiction to some of the ideas that he's also putting forward in his writing. And those predictions work has advantage because they promote him in subtle and a subtle sort of way through these classical ideas about what calligraphy does as a leader, as an emperor like figure who was constantly present in people's daily lives as the hand at the header of the People's Daily newspaper, The primary sort of voice piece for the state in, in China. So that covers our first object. And one of the things that got sort of skipped over there was that the bench at the communist after the end of World War Two. Prevent and drive out and chose party what remains to the island of Taiwan. And the Chinese Communist Party declares, declares itself on October first, 1949 as a new nation founded on communist ideals. And this painting done several years later commemorate that event. It's dung from the Tiananmen Gate of Heavenly Peace looking out over at Tiananmen Square. And here you can see that sort of old marble posts in the foreground, the various bridges. And here as Mao Zedong, backed by a series of artists, intellectuals and politicians standing at over the Army, the People's Liberation Army and over the, the peoples of sort of this communist China to announce this new Communist nation. And point Mao Zedong and sort of writing height of his power, the politics of the 19 fifties and the 19 sixties at within, internally, within the Communist already led to a lot of conflict and a lot of problems that we don't really have time to get into here. But one way in which we can sort of briefly think about them through visual arts is the way that several of these people were as points painted out of this major public oil painting that was hung in the People's Hall. The first person who painted out as this over here got Gong, who was considered even just a few years after this was painted, a counter-revolutionary cast out of the ship and he commits suicide not long after his fall from grace. You have both little shout she spent in the front who finds himself a sort of pitted against Mao Zedong HHS ideas about what the Communist party should be in the 160s painted out of this painting at a certain point. And then you have limb bought you a man who was back here painted out as well at the request or litigation, mouths milestones. Think it's third wife, Jiang Qing, who didn't like him in the portrait because he had opposed their marriage. And so this portrait is an interesting kind of microcosm for the politics of the next several decades in China in which Mao Zedong is at various points sort of. Not in control of the party and his fighting with many other leaders to maintain control. And that comes to a head in what's called the Cultural Revolution are the great proletarian revolution. In which in order to consolidate his power against his competitors within the communist party, Mao Zedong instigates this uprising from the youth. And the basic motivation here is that after 15 years or more than 15 years, the revolutionary avant garde or, or Latinist idea of revolution being a kind of continual, ongoing revolution against your outdated tendencies that had, had, had reached a kind of stalemate. And the people who are not acting revolutionary enough, people are not working against their capitalist or bourgeois attendance is. And so he creates a whole movement called for pollution that enables these brigades and young people, these are teenagers, exclude people your age for the most part, who went around denouncing, excuse me, anybody. They felt like who they thought was displaying revolutionary mentalities or, or actions. This could be the air, this could be the local Communist Party leader. This could be people's parents even. And it created a kind of fervor, especially in the first couple of years in which everybody was being outstanding, presumed guilty. And it was very hard to prove your innocence if he were accused of being a capitalist or a bourgeois sympathizer. And this revolution wreaked a lot of havoc on his culture. And on individual families. People who were found to be guilty were sometimes stone and beat to public. If you were lucky, you had to do some re-education and labor camps. You were often sent out into the very most distant parts of China to work in a labor camp. And people who are primarily susceptible to being accused of this were mostly intellectuals, anybody with an education, anybody trying to better China through these other kinds of means. And it was a great way for people to get rid of them. Get rid of their opponents. All you had to do was accuse somebody and that person was often cast out of their, of their role. And this is led by Mao and Little Red Book of all outs. Mao Zedong sayings going all the way back to the forties and thirties is put together for these revolutionary units of 16 to 24 year olds basically to go around. And the quote from as a means of denouncing people who they thought were not. Maintaining the revolutionary fervor. There was in fighting among these Red Guard units. And this whole period, especially the early part of this period of 1966 to 1976 when Mao Zedong dies, was a kind of ongoing internal political struggle to keep Mao on top. And it led to a lot of local turmoil. And this poster as part of the kind of propaganda produced for the Cultural Revolution uptick going. And as those of you who can read Chinese can see Mao Zedong handwriting. A signature is up here in his own hands, as well as a quote from his Little Red Book. And you have a young revolutionary, part of the Cultural Revolution quoting from the book as one hand is out and kind of forceful gesture when legacy forward, its mouth is open speaking the words of Mao Zedong from the book that he's holding up. And behind them are all these other youthful members of the army that the working class holding up their cop, that the book put their arm bands to sort of distinguish them. While these red flags of the, of sort of the bread being a color associated with communism. These blink red flags form the background. For this man speaking the kind of truths of Mao Zedong as a means toward continued revolution. And the header at the bottom reinforces this. It says, by means of Mao Zedong Thought, use it as a weapon in order to criticize the old world, in order to build a new world. And lots of posters like this were produced at this time. Or the Cultural Revolution. Here is sort of one of the more aggrandizing versions of that similar structure where you have a giant Mao Zedong over a sea of people all kind of rushing forward with their flags. For the red flag brigades, are there sort of revolutionary slogans written on them? And he has a giant red ink calligraphy brush in his hand and kind of heroic gesture as if he's written these words in the sky himself, or perhaps written these words below. Long live the total victory of the Great Proletarian revolution. Whole system, a whole kind of re, revolution that he built around this cult of personality around him, around himself in order to, in many ways consolidate His own power. Muslim essence, if any six, which puts an end to this kind of further moves, people were pretty tired of it at this point. But with his death comes a changing in leadership that leads to a much more controlled communist and socialist implementation of politics and strategy. Less of this sort of fervent ideological warfare. An interesting thing to note, though, is that calligraphy as a kind of sign of the person in charge, right? The chairman of the party maintains its an important model, Nian images like this, right, where Mao Zedong as shown with his brush or in the header for the People's Daily newspaper where we talked about him being present in every, in every person's everyday life. But in this calligraphy too, which is not mounds, stones calligraphy. But it is the piece to his mausoleum, which is in the middle of Tiananmen Square, where his body is on display. And it's the dome or Chairman Mao Memorial Hall. Calligraphy is written by his successor to the person who takes over the chairmanship of party after him is the person who writes calligraphy. Four Mao's tomb and incense connecting the two of them and asserting the presence of the new head of the party in connection with Mao Zedong legacy. And the style is drastically different and that's intentional. Hua Guofeng chooses this Tang Dynasty sort of irrigated or Angular or style, as opposed to mouths more fluid. Writing. In order to assert a change in leadership, a change in presence of the chairman. Interestingly, Hua will pass only a year or two in power for he is ousted and diminished very quickly, deprived of all of his leadership roles. While other members who had been suppress, Mao Zedong will rise to the top of leadership. Again, most prominently Deng Xiaoping, whose crack with transitioning China into the eighties and into a kind of system of government that exists today. That is. So it's got a capitalist characteristics. So moving on from that background and thinking about the kind of posters and what propaganda I want you to compare. The poster we just talked about to this poster from the 990s, which is our second object for, for today's class. And to think about how visually and structurally they are similar and different. We have some, I'd go ahead and pop them into the discussion board and talk about them as us. We just go back and there are a couple of questions that I didn't cover before. Colton that asked about the final I because I haven't written it yet. It's not live but go into the class schedule. It's linked to, it's linked at the bottom. And the day to day is designated in there as well. Drew asked about the Rape of Nanking. That's exactly one of the atrocities associated with the invasion of Japan in the 19 thirties. And Caleb's comment, I think probably related to click it right. So compare and contrast these two posters. Mm-hm. Great. You're all hitting on the key things I wanted you to take. Take a from this. Particularly the idea of the unity of, of, of a group of people all moving toward a similar kind of ideal, a united in somewhere. A lot of you pointed out, Caleb, Evan, sue us, talked about it. And drew. Ok. I'll all kind of mentioned this and Diana put it very nicely in the sense that you have the positioning of the figures and the composition being very, very similar as well with these low, these groups of people all moving together, coalition. And two other aspects that DO. Dimensions that are interesting and useful to think about are the use of text and the use of colors, which many of you talked about as well, whether that's Caleb or M0 or even these direct primary colors, right? A kinda muted blew, a striking kind of crimson, red, yellow, and then green color is being used to identify different kinds of people. Whether they're Army folks in the image on the right with the green or there. Members, other members of the Communist Party and the blue. Or whether in, on the left you have these different kinds of occupations, right? Signified. You have the kind of engineer with his plans in hand and his suit on. You have the looks like a kind of site manager or construction person, but the helmet on and the walkie talkie. Here's the army member, you have the Lady agricultural farmer on the far left. And all of these people, their bodies are kind of conjoined in a C. They're all moving in the same direction. And that's a progressive direction, right? You get the sense and the image on the right that this person in the foreground, that we're following him. And while there's not a single person in the foreground, in the Korean example, you do have this sculptural is flying kind of sculptural composition where you have n-type, they've read person, laborer and Pegasus, like flying horse that Lee is leaving everybody in a certain direction. But this relationship between that progressive, active collective body and it's simplify primary color farms. And the text is crucial. Think about within these propaganda posters. Within communist and socialist thinking, all of these things are unified toward the same idea. There's no contradiction in terms of what is happening. And this is true in general of propaganda, whether it is, you know, socialist, communist propaganda or otherwise. You are looking for a kind of clarity. There's, there's no gray zone here. Literally, but also figuratively in terms of thinking about the message and the action in the image supporting the same goal. The visual and the textual are all supporting the same concepts. And each of them in depending on what the poster is and whether what it's motivated foreign. And as we've talked about in your comparison here, right, there seem to be slightly different goals for each of these posters, but they're all kind of structurally the same with a band of text bottom. The group of people moving in a progressive direction. And these sort of simplified, easy to read gestures on these Rosie phased, healthy, happy, revolutionaries. Other things that come it is STRS is, and sometimes they're not always promoting, Right? So much as they're criticizing an idea and that idea, it might just be capitalism at large. It might be imperialist intervention. But the image always illustrates the text. Slogan at the bottom is always related to the image in some way or another and supports it. There's never kind of ambiguity there. These images are rarely attributed to one artist. They're produced in collective art groups. And so you have a collective Arthur, authorship mirrors the collective. Goals are communism and socialism and their reproduce wildly spread. Why? Because the text and the image are so easily legible, they're use to introduce him to enforce new political policy. And in both these cases, that's, that's what's happening in the image on the right. The Chinese cultural revolution is being promoted and kind of cult of Mao is forming around this text and the image in an image on the right. This is serving actually North Korean and movements. And we'll talk about that in just a minute. But to emphasize a kind of how propaganda works. Can you guess, even if you don't, mostly probably don't speak or read Korean. What's the message going on here? Just looking at the image. And it'll give me a kind of stab here. Great, great head-on. And that the United States, which is this long kind of thin arm with these sort of unwavering hands, right fingers with their long fingernails. And the US flag as the shirt is literally drawing an arc from the US to Korea of bombs. So how far can a bomb reached, which the US is a threat, as Matt put it, or stop the US threat than the Korean translates to the US is truly the axis of evil. And so even without being able to understand what the Korean says, you can understand directly from the image which if you look to the background, especially is emphasized by this large mushroom cloud and atomic cloud. And so again, the clarity of the image can be understood even by those who are illiterate. When it comes work an example, just to give you guys a little bit of background on how North Korea comes about its socialist communist structure. Korea had been released since the late 109's laughter, the Sino-Japanese War, but officially since 1910, it annexed by Japan. That meant that Japan was essentially making a colony out of the Korean Peninsula. And it's through that annexation and ruling over Korea that Japan invades China and tries to expand its empire, which we talked about last class and some this class. And in the aftermath of World War two and in the aftermath of the defeat of Japan. So Japan leaves the Korean peninsula. Korea is saved from Japanese occupation from two different trajectories from the south of the American troops come in and drive out the Japanese. And from the north, the Soviets do the same. And that. Play it influence over the North and the South as we'll eventually to a North Korea and South Korea. The question of how to create a new nation state being influenced in the north by the Soviets, from the south, by the Americans. And over the next three years, efforts to reunify the peninsula fail partly because of these contrasting advisory roles. And this is the beginning, of course, the Cold War throughout, throughout the world. And the North becomes socialist. Even the title, the People's Democratic People's Republic of Korea might hint. Otherwise, as you probably know, and many of you may even have relatives, grandparents that on the American side, I might have been part of the Korean War. After that reunification fails. There's a war effort to try and reunify. And America supports the South, whereas China is in the north. And again, this is all part of the ongoing Cold War that happens in the fifties, sixties, seventies, and into the eighties in the world. That is just around the conflicts in the ideals really of sort of capitalists, nation states and the socialist nation state. And so to this day, some of the largest US bases in Asia are, are in South Korea. O, just as with China, North Korea, as a relatively steady transition into its socialist nation state. Without a lot of support from neighbors, China was its nearest neighbor. China was trying to support its own transition into a fully functioning socialist state. North Korea becomes relatively self reliant and tries to correct it F3 and to create socialist industry where they're really worth the roots for it as there had been in time. Because because of the destruction of both World War II and the Korean War. And because of the fact that Korea had been occupied by a kind of, you know, parasitical power for the whole first, the 20th century in Japan. By Japan's occupation. And the first real collective socialist movement to try and increase productivity, to increase output agricultural and industrial was given this name, that totally ma, Movement in 1956. And that played off of an older legend. Legend of a horse that could travel for 10 thousand or 1000 leads. That is similar in many ways to the kind of mythical menu, right? And, and bring persevering, laboring animal in this, in this case. And the totally my horse is represented as a horse with winds that's carrying. You know, a man with a held up communist book and I'll labor or behind her. And this to make Korea self-sufficient supposedly worked the first time in 1956. If your production unit reached its quotas or surpass them, it was given that it was being a totally ma, unit. And this sort of competition between these labor units within the socialist structure of North Korea supposedly increase the increase the assertive production of industrial and agricultural output by 36% in the sort of late fifties and early sixties. A, an astonishing kind of spurt in growth that help to stabilize the early nation of North Korea. Our poster comes from a later period. Comes from 1999 when after a period of famine, after a period of various kinds of material shortages, due in part to the fact that North Korea was isolated from most other world powers. A second told him, movement is instigated with the same iconography. You told me Mom movement, right? Socialist posters with slogans on them, with the laboring classes unified moving forward. And let's hold him or the horse that go with 1000 leagues carrying the labourer and the social, the socialist idealist. On top of it, forward progressing in order to increase output. And the press release that came along with it names some of those ideals, right? And makes this recollection back to the first movement. The freshly says At the time of the first truly my movement, the Korean working people rushed forward and the spirit of told him are breaking through the trials and difficulties. The wise leadership of President Kim you. So by doing so they smash the imperialists sophism, career would not be rebuilt in a century and carried out the historical texts of industrialization in a matter of 14 years demonstrating the greatness of our country to the world. And then it transitions retro celebrating the leader, the great leader, the first leader of communist Korea. And then says right now the current situation is even more dire or difficult. Then the postwar period, the imperialists have isolated us and tried to suffocate us. And it has a great effect on the national economy. And now the Korean people are trying to free, instigate that spirit of told him on to spread its wings again and to make more progress. And so the poster is actually referencing an older idealists socialist movement from the 19 fifties in Korea. And in terms of revitalizing and motivating the people. Just as Mao Zedong description of what communist art should do. Motivating the people toward production and toward progress. So really doesn't matter. And this, these bullet points about propaganda are the same from the last slide. Whether we're talking about in a Leninist Marxism, the cultural revolution kind of propaganda, or the 990s propaganda that we looked at. Each of these has the same basic formula in terms of image and text, working together hand in hand without any ambiguity. And sort of celebrating a particular kind of figure head that unifies the people toward communist ideals. And just so we're clear about this, propaganda exists in all sorts of ways. And many of you have probably had to in the last election cycle. And this way in which a slogan and an image are working hand in glove to promote a very clear idea of what that slogan is trying to put forward is part of politics. Continuous, continuous slave. And here are examples from the 2006 campaign that sort of demonize both sides, but with the same set of strategies. You can think about them as propaganda posters, just as in the socialist and communist tradition. But instead, you know, popping up on your Facebook feed or your Twitter feed, et cetera. That's all for today. Any questions? Come to my office out? Sorry, I talked to me about it later. Later We have one more us on Tuesday before we sort of end on Thursday. And I'll name a review period just before the final where I'll be available over materials in the last class. Next Thursday we'll talk about the format of the exam, et cetera. But otherwise, try and have a nice weekend. Thicker. It'll between three to two.


## [20. Contemporary Art](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/129268/pages/20-contemporary-art?module_item_id=2446638)
 Right. All right. And to the last class lecture of the semester. Just for some final kind of keeping the Lu, asked lecture in the last class of the semester, Thursday will have a kind of a cat. And a few of the things we've done learned over the semester. We'll also set Er Bu De for the final if necessary, if you feel like it's necessary. And I'll leave a little time for you to fill out your class. Canvas, survey reviews for this, for the class this semester. And we'll talk about that as well. When it comes to the final exam, I believe this is all visible to you now on Canvas, including these notes about the format and the date to be Thursday, December or so week after Thanksgiving. And again, as with all of our exams, you can take it any time during that 24 hour period. Still open note, we get more time on this exam, a 120 minutes and more. If you have accommodations. There are 60 multiple-choice questions and there's no essay questions. I've switched because a lot of you seem to be very opposed to the choosing of multiple choices for a simple answer. So each of the questions has only one correct choice. You have to keep an eye out for answers that say all of the answers are correct or none of the answers, other answers are correct. So read all the questions carefully. And again, no Proctor Oreo required meaning you can look at your canvas pages and your personal notes. And to be honest, as I've emphasized in the past, looking at other web pages won't come in handy. It's just useless and please don't do it. Are there any things about this? Is again, on Thursday. It looks like most of you are pretty clear on the question pops up in chat that I will address it as it comes out. Though today, the last class we're dealing with a question that popped up. Right. So that's what I started off saying or mentioned stat is regarding Thursday. Thursday we'll set a review day, but there's not going to be a discussion board. Instead, come to the review, can prepare any questions I will be offering any more than I have in the rest of the class, but it's just one option will be available for you to raise any questions you have. That makes sense, Mindy? Sure. Today's class is on contemporary art in East Asia, from East Asian artists, et cetera. And we're going to be looking at three examples. There's a lot of, a lot of possibilities to choose from, but I've chosen an exit poll by an artist born in each of the countries that make up our East Asian core, that is China, Korea, and Japan. To start with. Let us do is born chronologically firstname Jin pack. And I wanted to just do a little comparison in the chat window to get your eyes and your ideas, your mind working today. Compare these two, right? But Yeah. This is a really good start. You guys. Let me just came in. So as you all as described, these might be compared on similar grounds in the sense that both show statue of the Buddha seated in a meditating position with design with one arm on his lap. When I'm down and the legs crossed and what's often referred to as lotus position in that, and in that sense as diarrhea. Eric, and many of you pointed out, the iconography is very much the same even though material. Is quite different. And that's something that was mentioned by Henan Central. Others, right? You have a bronze Buddha on the right. More portable statue, which is something that someone who, who do we have here? Someone someone brought that and I'm sorry, I'm trying to trying to give you guys just when I can but back to them to know its gets me a little lost, so I'll just continue on. So the materials are, are quite different. And the overall space of these two and sculptural sets occupies is quite different as Matt and Mindy in several people mentioned. In the complex of soccer, there's a whole sculptural set out supporting the central Buddha figure seated in meditational posture, including all of these different dot fas, guardians and attendance. Whereas in Jim pecks, TD Buddha, it's just him alone looking at himself, as Drew mentioned in his response. And as Diana and coltan also kind of broad, brought in to play, that's sort of our audiences are, are, are different here. In the audience. For the image on the right, the TV Buddha is a modern gallery audience, right? People looking for contemporary art as, as Diana put it. Whereas the audience on the left, as Drew also mentioned, are practicing Buddhists, right? And this is where we convened to expand based on kind of these comparisons in terms of thinking about what exactly is going on. That in turn, pecks a TV, Buddha and what commentaries it making on top of or by use of the Buddhist imagery. Photography that is common to Saatchi ammonia, right, the seated figure of fee, actual Buddha whose slim reputation and contemplating sort of fundamental Buddhist principles of the world. Going all the way back to our earlier classes about non-attachment, suffering, et cetera. A question really of who the audience is and how the sculpture makes contact with the audience is crucial to thinking about what an engine pecks. Sculpture is doing. So whereas the sculpture and the left seated meditation and the eyes are sort of half lit it usually in this, in this sort of sculptural iconography. And the Buddha in, because it's seeded in meditation, is actually looking inward, right? The eyes are only half open to the outward world, half paying attention. And instead, the mind is engaged with a kind of contemplation of self, of your own desires, your own attachments, et cetera. And that has a kind of higher thinking. And within that little sliver of, of eye contact from the sculpture is, is where a Buddhist practitioner standing in front of the sculpture would be seen by the Buddha who's really looking inward on itself in sculpts image. Now with an engine sculpture that stability for a viewer to be within the eye sight of this meditating figure that's reflecting on itself is cut. And instead what you have is a closed circuit television monitor that is shopping the Buddha back to it. Even as the Buddha's whose eyes are only half open, looks at the image of itself projected on the TV. And in that sense, that contemplated aspect of meditation, which is to go on internally in the mind, is transferred through the use of these technologies. Closed caption, video or closed circuit video monitoring and act contemplating the self can only be done in Buddha, in the TV Buddhist sculpture through the mechanism of video. You might think about that. While the mechanism of meditation or self-reflection has shifted and in TV, Buddha and the audience has shifted. As with all this secret of imagining yourself in the moment and unattached to the world is maintained actually for the technology of the TV Buddha in the sense that it is a live feed of oneself at a given moment right? Now attached to the past, not attach the future, but always present. And BEC is purposely working off of all this buddhist iconography which has been building up for centuries, right in the mind of anybody who is, begin to think about Buddhism or East Asian culture. Fat, instantly recognizable iconography is there as you saw. It's just cheese. Shifting the emphasis in terms of self-reflection and meditation onto the mechanism of technology at the ways in which a person can see and understand their own presence. This sculpture, which was first installed in 1974 and then has had many sort of iteration since then. And I think this is an image from 1976 installation. Bob Peck was born in Korea during the period of occupation that we talked about over the last two asses. And during the post-World War II period, during the Korean War, his family fled the fighting. To Hong Kong. They did, they moved to Tokyo and later named Jim back actually lived in West Germany as, as well. So his personal biography is very much a reflection of the increasing globalism of these World Wars and the displacement that, that causes. But in moving to all of these different contexts, first living and Japanese occupied Korea, then living in Hong Kong, where Cantonese is spoken in Tokyo or Japanese spoken in Germany. Named Jim pick actually ends up becoming much more of a kind of citizen of the world. And he's known for the most part as a kind of pioneer of electronic and video art. For example, of which you're seeing here very early on in the introduction of TV and video recording equipment notion back once experimenting with it and thinking about its effects on audiences and is sent. His medium was, was very much ground. It, the idea that technology, what his medium. It wasn't just sculpture or painting or anything else. It was the technological mechanisms themselves that he was, that he was interested in. When he is living in West Germany. Oh, he's as a classical musician and begins his training in that respect. He also become highly involved in the burgeoning contemporary art gallery worlds there. And in particular in experimenting with TV's, Which one of his earliest exhibitions, which he called an exposition of music and electronic television. In 1963. This included various kinds of sculptures that made out of these television. Sort of just conversation pieces, but interactive installation art. Here you can see images from this show in 1963, where he's done various things to distort the televisions and the way they transmit your images or otherwise. And to kind of live feed or realistically, and he's distorted those mechanisms by sometimes flipping the TV on its head and adding strong magnets to the top, which pull the image into horizontal bands. Sometimes altering the input mechanism so that people could below into things like photographs. And that would affect the way in which the TV words, TV image will be transmitted. And this experimentation, although it won't appear to many of us, is very guard, was extremely cutting edge for the early 19 sixties when a TV was a luxury item. It's 130s that television. And then at this point, black and white vision becomes available on. And on the market to most of the upper middle class folks. At, right? When it comes to America's sort of love for television, it's not until the late 130s that American audiences even get introduced to TV at all. Color TV doesn't come in until the mid-fifties, just a decade before these experimental sculptures are being made by June Peck. And then the mechanisms to record, right, to actually play it. Make your own video recordings aren't introduced until the mid to late sixties with VHS and VTR technologies, which were first invented in Japan. And so just as these sorts of materials were being, Purdue are consumers. And Amazon pick was already thinking critically about them as mechanisms for conveying information and images and thinking of them sculpture really, as well as artistically, how do I manipulate these mechanisms that in many ways are designed to manipulate the modern postwar consumer. And he's attitudes of thinking about what post-war technology, what effect post-war technology had on sort of the global consumer? Part through named Jim pecks relationship with a group called Fluxus, which wasn't into when he was living in Germany. And flux, this is a sort of artist group, an artist commune. And in a way, the main figures sort of changed and switched over its 15 years or so of practice. But these artists lived from across Europe, America, and Japan as, as well in their general take on, a kind of art should be made was that they were against the commercial production of things to be hung on walls in homes or in museums. And in that sense they called themselves are kind of anti A-R-T or ART Anti art for art's sake. Sort of. They were much more interested in events and happenings. That is, creating art pieces that could be experienced singularly that were not commodity objects to be purchased in galleries. For instance, Alison Knowles, One of the fluxes members from America. One of her early pieces, a Fluxus art was proposition number two, and it was just make a salad. That's the simple instruction, is the piece itself. You make us out whenever z and with whomever is at. And the idea is that in the process, you, the making of this our, builds a structure for social interaction. A famous Fluxus artist you've probably heard of its Yoko Ono, more famous generally for her relationship to the Beatles. But she was an early Fluxus artists from Japan. Just as an engine, Peck was an early Fluxus artist from Korea. And a commonality to much of fluxes art was sort of instructional mechanism. That is, you could make the art anywhere in with any. Since her mirror piece instructions are, instead of obtaining a mirror, obtaining a person, look into him, use different pupil, young, fat, small, et cetera. I got thinking about how it is that you are engaging with the world around and the people around you. So not relying on a kind of static art object to inspire you to interaction with the world, but using people to think about how you are seeing in the world. And different kinds of people who might not otherwise interact with is a sort of neat group. Yoko Ono, St. Peter's was also quite involved with some of the performative and experiments on music of the fifties and sixties as part of his Fluxus interests and as part of his own musical training background. He was performing Chopin in Cologne. And he knew that the famous contemporary composer, John Cage was in the audience. And in the middle of his peace, he puts the cello down, rushes John Cage where the pair of scissors cuts as time and put shampoo in his hair and then ends his performance. And so in many ways the music was the kind of pre, amble to the act of absurdity, of coming out into the audience and sort of breaking that tension that exists between the audience and the thing or person performing or seen. And maybe your readings come in. Why don't we take another break and think about, or in our chat window. These scores as an image and peck called them write, using the musical terminology. Try imagining yourself in the performance of one of these three scores. I've missed a word there, but what were the effects will be, and what makes this an artwork to you? So go through the imaginative process, think about what the effects will be on the audience. And then think about what this kind of qualifies as our take a few minutes, answer those questions, and then we'll discuss them. Great book that specific pieces worth pointing those out. But your general sense, as Tyler starts, this is would be shocking, right? You're actually people What the hell is going on. As diarrhea put it, it will create what rage and controversy because it's moving against, as she put it, the kind of normative behavior, which is exactly the point as Diana, Eric, and Dari, I'll put her it's about challenging and disrupting the kind of normal order of things, challenging our presumptions about what is proper. And as Evan put it, one of the things that's interesting about this is that you can pick anybody to do these with, right? They're not commodity Artworks, right? They're not things sold in galleries. It is an action that you take. That is the artwork. And what that does is it shakes you out of your normative understanding of world and gives you a new perspective. And these different act pins are often very bodily. As you might have noticed. They often make direct references to nationalism or to post-war effects. For instance, the atomic bomb victim. Parts of sort of performative theatre is where you have two uniformed men, as the instruction say, gas masks on the carrier stretcher with a so-called atomic bomb victim. Which is a woman with half of her body urging the manner of pool wounds and deformations. And the other half in a sex feast, whatever. That is for this sort of performances or to interpret. And this idea of kind of war and desire being part of the same body of thinking or knowledge and leading to atrocities like the atomic bomb and its effects on the people of Nagasaki. And Hiroshima was especially in the mid-to-late sixties to reflect on what was only really recent history. And which would gear up in many ways again, in the context of the sixties and places like Vietnam. Moving theater again as a disruptive act, right? You have a whole group of people who take your car and you drive them into a crowded city. You turn off the engines and it shuts down all of the normal mechanisms of movement, of circulation of people, of circulation of goods. And it's a way of kind of protesting or moving against normative behavior. And then lastly, our champion contest is combining this sense of kind of visceral bulk action with nationalism. So performers are gathering around large bucket and male p into the bucket. And as each one peas, they sing their own national anthem. Since stops, they stop singing. And the last one is the champion. And it's making fun of this idea of nationalism as a kind of heroic and especially a masculine endeavor. By reducing it to something as simple as a pissing contests, quite, quite literally. And it's these ideas that are again critical of especially the post-war kind of return to normalcy after World War Two. And do a kind of embracing of capitalist culture that many of the flexes, Fluxus artists were. Again submit names and peck embraces as well. Having been somebody who's lived through the Japanese occupation of Korea, having fled the Korean War and having lived in post-war Germany, as well. Admob pecks early roots in terms of questioning the very nature of what an artwork can be. You know, not something for sale in the gallery. And the things that in sixties and seventies later needed is in paint is the things that are reconfirming the way in which we interact with the world. He was really very interested in TV and in particular, this piece here is with one of his collaborators, the cellist Charlotte Berman, called TV broth for living sculpture. And as he writes about the piece, he tries to explain. The sort of dynamics of what is a bare chested woman playing the cello with TV's, one over each breast, as if it were a TV bra literally. And he writes, real plight issue here. And this idea of art and technology is not to make some other gadget or toy, but to how to humanize the technology or the like, any electronic medium. Which even at this point in the sixties he thought was progressing too rapidly. And it's outstripped as he thought the ability to really program or control well what the electronic medium was doing. And so this particular piece, TV Brasilia for living sculpture with Charlotte moment, is one way in which he thought about humanizing our electronics and technology. Humanizing and a kind of blunt and humorous way. He writes By using the bra of TV as a bra, which is the most intimate belonging of a human being, will demonstrate the use, human use of technology. And I'll stimulate yours up for something mean, but stimulate their fans to look for the new imaginative and humanistic ways of using our technology. And what he's implicating here in the viewing of television programming or the viewing of any kind of electronic programming or listening to it really is the desire as aspect of that fee appeals to the consuming kind of person and body. And he's making this explicit with something like the TV busier, in which she courage to look exactly where it's impolite to look at the chest of Charlotte Mormon, which is covered by these televisions projecting these images back out at you. And so again, it's making you very aware and perhaps even uncomfortable of the implicit desire that is folded into things like TB, TV programming and electronic revolution that was happening in the sixties and seventies. He was a pioneer of robots in arched as our robot K 4-5-6, which is named after Beethoven work, opus cave 4-5-6. This robot's, he would create these very, very simple mechanisms so that it could speak. Really just play recordings. You would manipulate it and walk down the street playing different recordings, whether it was music, the speeches of Robert or John Cassidy. Sometimes he would play the robot could poop as well. He had a poop out little beans to make it. So the kind of more nature. But the whole time of course, he is being very facetious about it or humorous about it. Efforts at making this human or are very minimal at best. The robots only until 1983 when he staged the first and depth of the 21st century as he called it. Again, using irony here because 81983 is not yet the 21st century and was first death of the 21st century. He wheeled. Robot K4, 5-6 out into traffic and had it hit by a car. So two machines colliding with one another, one machine murdering another. Here's another example of the kind of stuff is going to have to have to pop out here. I use of is sort of medium of television to ask them to think about what it is that we do when we sit in front of a TV and absorb that information. Hold on just a moment while I share this thing. I'm a barber. Thump, thump, thump. They stop being able to see a YouTube channel. I think to volume should my country is a state of mind by country it's a state of mind. My country it's a state of mind. The country gives a state of mind come treated as a straight line and country is a state of mind. As a state of mind kind of guess the state of line is, this is the state of mind. And of my straight line eight of my my my my area a or n 0000. So you get the point. Fair. But let me reiterate as I move back to the tent. Full non shuffle, shuffle, shuffle. You just get a confirmation. They're all kinda the PowerPoint again. Just drop grit, right? So Daria says is terrifying and it's terrifying. It's a wall, TV screens, which is a more common thing to see. And stories of the eighties where the whole front of department store would just be newest tribute televisions are going into the television section of a, of a Best Buy, Right? But he's programmed them all to create a fag, as you can see, that is made up of various shifting images that have Nationalists, sort of currency or ideas embedded in them. And the overlay of this sort of ominous voice starts off with a full sentence, my country as a state of mind, right? Getting us to think again about nationalism as concept that we engage each and sort of create, right? It's a way of thinking in the world. And as that phrase compresses in on itself, a couple of things happen. You should have heard that most heinous of C words being dropped. If you didn't, you can go back and look at it if if that entertains you. And then as it further reduces, it comes down to just the resonant tone of ohm, which is used in meditation practice to resonate sound and the chests and to focus myself on the human body. And so again, meditating through the nationalism for the kind of most reduced idea. Through often this play of the visceral or this play of the obscene, in which he drops the steward in on the party. And can think about this in terms that you're all quite used to. These days. Most of you probably are aware of the overwhelming effects of electronic engagement and interaction as we're distracted by it constantly. And the way in which it reduces our ability to interact with people around as well. And I'm Jim Peck was thinking about this as early as the 19 sixties when TV was just coming out. But in a way that sort of prescient in terms of predicting what was, what was coming in the current U2 WeChat. Because Snapchats not really a thing anymore, but Instagram revolution, we understand ourselves through the media that we use to represent ourselves and that in turn, are selling us things. It's like I'm Jim subtypes. So he had a great thanks, Matt. I'm not too yet. We'll get there. I'll get there. So that moves us into another artist who was born in China, an artist named Wang Ping. And who was an installation artist and conceptual artist, came of age in China during the 19 eighties. And this is probably his most famous early work, was exhibited at a very well-known exhibition called China avant garde. That happened at the China Fine Art Museum in Beijing in the late 19 eighties. In the sculpture is literally it's the image you see in the middle. But it is literally the instructions again, like with fluxes, like with him Jim pecks instructions. It is literally what has been done in the title. He takes a history of Chinese painting on the left and a history of modern Western arch on the right. And he puts them in a washing machine for minutes until both of these histories are reduced to a wet pile in comprehensible mush. And here's his little label explaining what, how it was done on the data was done and just plopped on a, it looks like a piece of glass on a crate. And left for the viewer to think about what exactly is happening in the image. And again, some of the same strategies that engine Peck is up to our happening in this, in that try to, there's a critique of nationalism. Writes, history of Chinese painting is a painting of the history of the nation or a history of the nation through painting. Talked about the description of painting as national style or Chinese painting that came in the early 20th century with people like Shu Bei home. Well, by the 19 eighties when you're paying is making that's that concept of sort of nationalize painting had very much set in and the ideas are very much still in vogue, are still popular among Chinese artists. In the eighties, as China was beginning to develop economically, was of adopting the sort of modern ideas and modernist ideas of various Western art form to the Western art canon in the same way that she be home was interested in doing it in the same way that Kino whole guys painting in the Nationalist period in Japan. It's sort of taking the best of both worlds, right? The material, the iconography, one kind of painting, mixing with the techniques of the other. Well, this has been going on for a while, but it's, I'm on yong pin is offering this critique of that very sort of belonged way of thinking about how to make new painting where you mix this one thing with another. Well, if you literally just mix them, these nationalized histories of Western art or Chinese art, you get meaninglessness. And this is exactly what I'm Yang Ping wants is contemporary artistic audiences to think about. And so the artwork is instigating a conversation around these ideas and nationality and art and art history and how those canons of art history or created. Let's look at pong pings text. And she makes a series of comparisons. What do you think this is about a philosophy without an extensive kind of art historical vocabulary? It will be difficult and will expand on this in the lecture later. Sort of see what's happening here. But what exactly is this text about from 1986 around the same time that his History of Western Art, History of Chinese art in the washing machine is made right. Mm-hm. If it is confusing. Mm-hm. Because they're hitting some, some of the key idea here. And really this moment of the eighties in China is after this sort of tumultuous period of the sixties and seventies where we had the Cultural Revolution. In the late 19 seventies. Students start going back diversity. Because during the Cultural Revolution, all universities were closed as well. Education systems. Stopped. And there was a slow kind of opening up of China to the outside world with what Deng Xiaoping called trickle down economics, which started in the major urban centers. And then suddenly kind of urbanized China through an embracing of some capitalists characteristics, some privatization of industry, et cetera. And this to kind of access to various ideas from outside of China, a decreasing isolationism. And so in the 19 eighties you have people like Cong Yong Ping who are thinking about the histories of art that they've been given if it grew up with that were explicitly socialist and Marxist. And then are comparing it to what's happening in various Western art capitals like London or New York where postmodern art is in full effect. Talks about this period in the middle of the eighties, right at the very beginning, about the kind of modernisation of, of Chinese art. Again, after the strong socialist period of the sixties and seventies. And that this moment in the eighties was full of a lot of experimentation. But as Christina started us off by saying, you know, it wasn't necessarily producing memorable or good art according to Huang Yong Ping, but it was necessary to turn what had been the establishment in terms of what art was and where shown. Turn it on its head. Much in the same way that Nim Jin Peck was doing right? By inverting in many ways the expectation of what the artwork is. I'm hoping he's very honest what's happening AT. She said a lot of the times we're experimenting and imitate other things to try him make a crude version of, of something that was ours. And this concept that he arrives that is very interesting because it creates a kind of specifically Chinese genealogy or history of post-modernism that is separate from postmodernism in the west. And he begins by shifting off of this idea of what data is right. This idea of non-sensical behavior, nonsensical art, often performative, often based and laws are and mixing up various kinds of images don't normally go together. And he said that sort of moment was happening in the eighties. He associated with actually a Postmodernism. And he said that this was like Chan or Zen Buddhism. And by doing that, he's going to a history that pri dot, dot, that's from the early 20th century in the 19 twenties for the most part and Thursdays. And it's a western, mainly German and French art movement. And is saying is that we'll actually, those ideas are predated by similar idea. In Is philosophy and religion. And he draws these kinds of new genealogies, right? He says, Rauschenberg. His use of whatever he came across in terms of collaging elements together and screen printing them. Robert Rauschenberg in the 19 sixties and seventies. This is like Taoist ideas of equality. Sameness can coexisting Marcel Duchamp, this famous intellectual artist of the early 20th century as a lot like Laozi as concept of hiding one's brilliance and appearing doll and simple. And goes on to talk about they'll Duchamp's urinal, which he just transposes into the gallery space and flips it on its side to make an artwork to question this idea of what is art. He talks about men's ONE WHO packaged up his own shit because own feces and package it like canned goods to sell it. And he talks about these early 20th century ideas into their concepts of questioning what the object was. In terms that are, Zheng, He talks about mastery in a famous Zen Buddhist from the 13th century. Who talks about the Buddha dried turd or feces stick has this translation, puts it. And so this idea of well questioning the nature of the Buddha and Zen is a lot like questioning the nature of art that Duchamp, Manzoni, Rauschenberg, these other modernists, post-modernists are about. And so he says Who actually Zen is the same thing as Dava, chime, Sam, and data is the same thing as Zen or chime. And postmodernism is The New Renaissance actually of Buddhas. And that it's a crop all sorts of historical in a, through lines and genealogies. But what it does is it frees Huan Yong Ping from relying Western models of modernism and post-modernism because he can rely instead on Taoism and Zen Buddhism. So this essay is really a kind of conceptual pivoting mechanism to allow for a kind of art in the eighties and nineties in China that was not reliant on Western models. And here's some examples of the things that he's citing For those of you for whom the data are, postmodernism isn't immediately bringing up images. Lodge was a major form of data so as nonsense, speaking and performing. And this was an avant garde, modernist art movement. And the tens and twenties that was just like Fluxus was for Nim Jim pick, very anti, aren't very critical of the status quo in the prewar and mid war period. Postmodernism is a term that is generally applied to art from the sixties and seventies onward. That was critiquing sort of idealism of modernism, of reducing things to pure forms of the kind of technological love affair that a lot of modernist had. And part of that critique was in doing things like what Robert Rauschenberg does in this image on the bottom left. Or he's just overlapping. Meaningful just barrel accumulations of paint and objects and sometimes printed images in ways that creates friction and meaning with one another, even if at, an earlier narrative didn't necessarily exist. So pure act of juxtaposing are overlapping things creates meaning. And it's a common sort of experience. And in the modern and postmodern world, this is Duchamp's famous urinal. And here's an image of Pilgrim ends only packaged artist shit, which he sold as a kind of direct product of the artist body. Interesting fact, some of these were not C And so well. And they treated in a variety of ways that modern canned goods or to prevent the growth of gas in bacteria. And on occasion, men's ON these cans have actually exploded under their own pressure. So if you're thinking of purchasing one as an investment, makes sure that it's not unexploded can of crap. But again, we might look all the way back to our example of Zen Buddhist. And to think of the use of coal on strike is nonsensical phrases that here attachment to meaning they procure attached to language as a reliable form of understanding, experience and conveying experience to other, other people. As moment talking about in the eighties as part of the 85 new way of art. Where you at a variety of different groups springing up for especially urban centers in China and find new art. And boy, that wasn't propaganda stick, right? Because this was the Aren't they had all grown up on and participated in, in making art that was for the states aren't, and how to direct political message. There's no ambiguity in it whatsoever. And freed from those streets. In the eighties, a lot of artists went into a very experimental stages. So one of Guangdong pings earlier pieces was with collective group, the shampoo dot dot group there called chairman data because chairman at the city, but they were working in. And data is the word that's taken from the European art movement we just talked about. But Hongyan pings kind of celebrating as a kind of Zen Buddhism for modern Europe, right? Exhibition. Well, what they did was critique the exhibition hall as the primary space where you went to go see art. It's a criticism of the museum is the only place where art is c. And again, this is a critique also of the socialist sort of state run system in which municipal and provincial art gallery it controlled what was really qualified as, as art. But people called ART. So this collective sham on data made an exhibition for the Fujian Art Museum with nothing in it. Instead, as the essay goes that introduce the show. What is shown here consists of no painting or sculpture, right? These typical art forms. It's an exhibition of art, event characterized by self-definition, offensiveness, as well as continuity. All works on display must come from the various materials that are stocked in the open air around the museum. He's materials are not uses art mediums to be decorated or constructed form, but are simply displaced into the exhibition hall. And the target of the attack is the exhibition hall. As a model, our system, not the exhibition hall itself. This isn't art exhibition without works of art. But that process look like below you have the jsonData artist finding things out in the street and various trash piles recycling various construction sites. And then they just displace those things into the museum to get people to ask the question, well, how is it that I given r? What is, what do I define? His own artwork is something you see in a museum or in a hall. And this critique of the canonization of art, it works and the celebration of certain things as artwork. She simply because the right people called them artworks, runs through Guangdong Ping's work at large has other, one of the other pieces at the later at night, it is Avant China Avant-garde show the proposition to literally tear the whole front of the building or the facade off of the National Art Museum in Beijing. And the Swiss design, he would just have a lot of people tie ropes to the facade, bunch of benching mechanisms. And everyone was just going to pull into the whole face came off. And these ideas of critiquing the ways in which we decide what is art. Coming to this step that we started off with the Guangdong pink pigs, where he's taking aim instead of that museum spaces is taking aim at textbooks, at the kinds of histories that leaves some artworks out in favor of the kinds of things. And he's also taking aim at the kind of love on Western models of modernism for art. Just as in his own essay where he goes back to St. August, ideas that predate modern art and says, well, we have our own lineage of concepts that we can turn to for postmodernism. And in this sense, these, these works like this are, you know, very much about Chinese postmodernism and critiques of the genealogies that are being absorbed from the past and also from the prospect within China. This brings us to our last artist, Akash him were coming. And many of you actually might have heard of Murakami. He's very successful, commercially successful artist. And this particular painting comes from a period when he was already very, very well known globally as m. Because it contemporary artists, the title 100 are hot, refers to all of these cranky looking, kind of busted up old do ads in this image. This is a massive painting to wall-sized painting image. You have a series of again different kind of be still an old figures of different scales and sizes looking out at the viewer from the pirate. Well, psychedelic rainbows swirl in their eyes and their Bert being weird. Gases full of strange colors and making these sort of grimaced faces. And all of this is actually again, just like Guangdong painting, playing off of Buddhist iconography and are hot. You can think about the sort of stages of making it up to Buddha. Lemme write the Buddha is the top right. This guy who escapes rebirth reaches nirvana, understands the basic nature of the world. And then you have your Bodhisattva was right. These beautiful bejeweled hermaphroditic figures that helped to guide people in the world. And then you can think a step lower than that. You got these guys. They are often modeled off of hermits who spent lots of time in the woods, whose hair is kind of grown out and who are sometimes hundreds and thousands of years old in legend, which gives them long eyebrows. Something that happens as, as bodies grow old, lumpy kind of physiognomy, right? Very strange and out sized or out proportioned features that are signs of their age and their wisdom. And to the figures that Murakami is depicting in this image. These y's often crazy old men for the most part. I think they're all men within Buddhist iconography. But you find out in the woods that reveal to you certain secrets or ideas about Buddhism. Bodhidharma, right back to our painting feature as part of this Buddhist iconography that Murakami is engaged with at this point in his career. In late 2 thousand, in the early 20 tens, creating these campuses that are these pixelated forms with the psychedelic colors of the basic Buddhist iconography of these strange hermit like men, whether it's Bodhidharma or the arhats in the image we just saw. And you can see the titles like the one here, which is the, it says Bodhidharma. But the title. Given an English to the painting, is initiate the speed of cerebral synapse at free will. Right? The idea of snap and bring your logic making mechanisms of language, the normal ways in which you understand the world, to understand the broader nature of the world. And the particular set of images. And this particular large painting, a mural that we're looking at in this class are kinda prime image was done after the major earthquake, the Tohoku, Tohoku earthquake in 2011, that created a tsunami which then damage to nuclear reactor at Fukushima, leading to nuclear meltdown at the power plants. In this area of the is still toxic today because of the radiation. And this was a major catastrophe that affected Japanese folks very, very deeply and also effected fishing. Ecosystems beyond Japan. Moves to these sort of distort it. Mutated forms of aha, our hearts as a way of thinking through this disaster. In the exhibition where he first introduced these images, he had an ancient Buddhist temple gateway transpose into the museum space. In the background you can see some of these giant paintings as well as giant sculptures of these sort of mutated figures. And the artist himself shown here, created this sort of alter, alter ego, persona with three heads of three old men compressed together that he wore on top it. Description of the motivations behind it and said to me, religions are still kind of narrative. Natural catastrophes, earthquakes there, things caused by nature and such chaos is natural. We have to make sense of it somehow. And so we have to invent these stories of, of religion. And this is what I wanted to paint. So he's thinking through the language of Buddhism for the contemporary moment. And particularly the sort of mutated versions of our hots righties. These misconstruing or adapting the old forms of these arhats faces, but they're lumps and bumps and their long eyebrows and Crazy Eyes. And thinking about them through the idea of nuclear meltdown and mutation. And this fits in general within Murakami is larger kind of oeuvre or work from before this turn of aesthetic vocabulary began in the 19 nineties to circle around this one term that you coined called super flat. And materially, what it refers to is if compressed space in the image. Where are some image? Reduce? Simple, flat and patronized forms. Goal. Hotel, beef in the background for him, a kind of flat backdrop that reflects light and therefore the paint stands out in contrast to it. Or flatness of his images right there. Thought patterns. There isn't a lot of deep recession in terms of the space. He is thinking about this through a couple of mechanisms. One to a traditional Japanese painting that we haven't looked at in this class called the REM PA, school. A school of painters in 80 period in particular created that were sort of liberal sense that Murakami, he's talking about it. Flat patronized zones such as this river or stream that runs across these four screens. And images like these hyper stylized plum blossom trees that are simplified is sort of pure forms in which the surface treatment of the, it, it takes on it's a kind of life, right? It's reduced to these patterns of most as an inks that are, when you look closely at this image, whoops, back it up. Just a splotch array of tie dyed overlapping, wash it. And so images. You work hard and began to call super fat. Really to have as much feel. A d is taken from classical Japanese painting. The gold background, the pattern I as often natural subject matter. But it also is with critique of hyper capitalist world of the 19 eighties and nineties and into the present in which everything becomes a commodity. And this idea of hyper capitalism, coined in the seventies and eighties by a person named Fredric Jameson. Marxist thinker, describes capitalist beyond or definition of what that is in which absolutely every interaction in commodified, that is, it's given a kind of price and value in the market. And again, you might think about this through the various apps that are tracking your movements and convincing you in various ways, sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle. To buy more things, you will literal every like and every interests is commodified in this kind of a system. And Murakami is critique of, of that involves a kind of embrace. Of everything being commodified of that fetish of or toward the commodity object and the emptiness sort of inherent in that thing. It's value is, and it's exchange ability, but other things that are just ok. For instance, if you've heard of Murakami, you might know that he has done a line of Louis Vuitton bags. But he was quite famous for, and the two thousands and an early 20 tens in which he took some of his female psychedelic eyeballs is little cartoon eyes and created a logo with the Louis Vuitton logo. And these bags for often, you know, 34 times with the original back would have been worth. They were kind of collaboration and pitched it. Super flout moves into the commodities sphere very directly with these collaborations that we're not just about Gallery shown artworks fret about embracing things that we don't even think about as art forms, right? The branded mechanisms, luxury bags. And they are in many ways, is an estimate of psychedelic tripped out flat cartoon like set of languages for describing everything from our, our hots to these eyeballs on little Eva told logo, comes back to cartoon culture and animate. This somewhat earlier work feature is a recurring figure. I'm Mickey Mouse like figure and mirror comments outward. Dob, DOB in which we have the big ears and the sort of friendly face of Mickey Mouse like figure. But Don's finished. The pupils dilate and hyper colorized In Rainbows. The teeth they've all gone rainbow, the surface of the paint is built up, then also sanded down to really 2m via these sort of under layers of a kind of lack of a, of a pure consistent surface. This sort of gradient, industrialized street art version of what these comic figures could be or looked like their disintegration in a way. And the integration combined with the other aspects of mutation of a kind of ramped up our hyper accelerated image as you'd get with this tornado, the castle of Tintin, where this Bubblegum in a lassie goes, the set of eyes and teeth, gnashing teeth that is all kind of conformed and mutated into one. While the spray is a bubblegum, bubble balls spit out left and right. He's interested in pushing our desire for these basic sort of things like candy and cute creatures into around that's a little bit more venomous, put more evil. And that is really pointing the kind of nature of our desire that's folded into these otherwise cute creatures. Fe2 sculptures got a lot of attention in the late nineties where he was really working with a lot of MMA figures in particular. And animate fingers for the most part, are trapped in a kind of adolescent moment with these big eyes and these giant hairdos and these simplified narratives in which they live as soon as pseudo, pseudo super heroes. Something we also associate with comic books in general and kind of adolescent desire. And he's taking that desire and pushed it to the limit. These are censored. I felt the need to do that for those of you who are a little bit more conservative. But if you uncensored, These are look for them. You can see quite clearly that he's taken these sort of innocent, BIG guide, child-like features and put them on bodies. Engaging and very adult actions. My lonesome cowboy as evacuating a last Sue in the air with this sort of cheerful smile on as if he is fighting bad guys with it. And heroic bone is making a kind of a jump rope out of breast milk coming from breast that could not possibly supported by the body that she's given. Everything in these sort of cartoon worlds is pushed into this kind of cheer Rubik, innocence like states. And one thing that Murakami is interested in is pointing out the not so innocent aspects of enemy and Khartoum world desires, but also folded within this R. Again, references to classical Japanese iconography and painting. This rim PA, coming back to that flatten aesthetic that was dominant. And one school of painting in Japan, there's Rinpoche aesthetic involved. God of the winds and a God of the thunder. That's part of where these two characters are being pushed through the language of something by Dragon Ball Z. And so our Dang again, coming back to our painting here, as a result of this interest in the hyper capitalists moment, this interest in the Fukushima nuclear meltdown disaster and the mutation of forms that happens with nuclear fallout. Seen through both the lens of anomie creatures and this sort of cartoon like aspects of those, those figures in there. Suppose it innocence. And also the sort of fetishized hyper capitalist world that Murakami is also working in and through and the rest of his artwork. So if we think about these guys together of these sort of artists, we might also think about the transnational and global art that's happening here. And each of these artist, it doesn't particularly, because we can ask, doesn't particularly matter that Nim Jin pick as Korean. Hung paying is Chinese are born in China even though he lived most of his life in France. And the Takashi Murakami is Japanese and he lives in several major cities. And while each of these represents somebody born in an East Asian country, their art is really playing at concepts of the exchange between these nationalist ideas and critiques of these nationalist ideas of, of history. And they get us to question the nature of what is East Asian about this heart. For you remember that the idea of being east Asian is really established with the colonialist ideas of the Japanese empire. Then the fact that we still use it sometimes repeats that kind of colonialist rhetoric if we're not careful. But each of these is engaged with a kind of criticism of art that existed beforehand. Or criticism, in many ways, the solidity of an East Asian identity, right? It's now seen through various culpable international, internationally sold commodities like Louis Vuitton bags or television. And each of them involves a certain amount of play or nonsense, right? Kind of ridiculousness, as well as a dependency on the international art market to support each of these artists. And that's taken us just a little over time. That's the last lecture of the class. And I hope when we come to class on Thursday and we can think again holistically over what we've learned this semester. I'm sure I look forward to seeing you Thursday for a more relaxed session, and I hope you have a good afternoon. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
